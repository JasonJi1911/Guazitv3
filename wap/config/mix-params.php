However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. ','”My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, ”have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” ','Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. ','”But it is,” returned she; ”for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” ','Mr. Bennet made no answer. ','”Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently. ','”You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” ','This was invitation enough. ','”Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” ','”What is his name?” ','”Bingley.” ','”Is he married or single?” ','”Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!” ','”How so? how can it affect them?” ','”My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, ”how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.” ','”Is that his design in settling here?” ','”Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” ','”I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.” ','”My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” ','”In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” ','”But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” ','”It is more than I engage for, I assure you.” ','”But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” ','”You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.” ','”I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.” ','”They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; ”they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.” ','”Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.” ','”You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.” ','”Ah! you do not know what I suffer.” ','”But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” ','”It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.” ','”Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them all.” ','Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.  ','凡是有钱的单身汉，总想娶位太太，这已经成了一条举世公认的真理。这样的单身汉，每逢新搬到一个地方，四邻八舍虽然完全不了解他的性情如何，见解如何，可是，既然这样的一条真理早已在人们心目中根深蒂固，因此人们总是把他看作自己某一个女儿理所应得的一笔财产。 ','有一天班纳特太太对她的丈夫说：“我的好老爷，尼日斐花园终于租出去了，你听说过没有？”','班纳特先生回答道，他没有听说过。','“的确租出去了，”她说，“朗格太太刚刚上这儿来过，她把这件事的底细，一五一十地告诉了我。”','班纳特先生没有理睬她。','“你难道不想知道是谁租去的吗？”太太不耐烦地嚷起来了。','“既是你要说给我听，我听听也无妨。”','这句话足够鼓励她讲下去了。','“哦！亲爱的，你得知道，郎格太太说，租尼日斐花园的是个阔少爷，他是英格兰北部的人；听说他星期一那天，乘着一辆驷马大轿车来看房子，看得非常中意，当场就和莫理斯先生谈妥了；他要在‘米迦勒节’以前搬进来，打算下个周未先叫几个佣人来住。”','“这个人叫什么名字？”','“彬格莱。”','“有太太的呢，还是单身汉？”','“噢！是个单身汉，亲爱的，确确实实是个单身汉！一个有钱的单身汉；每年有四五千磅的收入。真是女儿们的福气！”','“这怎么说？关女儿女儿们什么事？”','“我的好老爷，”太太回答道，“你怎么这样叫人讨厌！告诉你吧，我正在盘算，他要是挑中我们一个女儿做老婆，可多好！”','“他住到这儿来，就是为了这个打算吗？”','“打算！胡扯，这是哪儿的话！不过，他倒作兴看中我们的某一个女儿呢。他一搬来，你就得去拜访拜访他。”','“我不用去。你带着女儿们去就得啦，要不你干脆打发她们自己去，那或许倒更好些，因为你跟女儿们比起来，她们哪一个都不能胜过你的美貌,你去了，彬格莱先生倒可能挑中你呢？”','“我的好老爷，你太捧我啦。从前也的确有人赞赏过我的美貌，现在我可有敢说有什么出众的地方了。一个女人家有了五个成年的女儿，就不该对自己的美貌再转什么念头。”','“这样看来，一个女人家对自己的美貌也转不了多少念头喽。”','“不过，我的好老爷，彬格莱一搬到我们的邻近来，你的确应该去看看他。”','“老实跟你说吧，这不是我份内的事。”','“看女儿的份上吧。只请你想一想，她们不论哪一个，要是攀上了这样一个人家，够多么好。威廉爵士夫妇已经决定去拜望他，他们也无非是这个用意。你知道，他们通常是不会拜望新搬来的邻居的。你的确应该去一次，要是你不去，叫我们怎么去。”','“你实在过分心思啦。彬格莱先生一定高兴看到你的；我可以写封信给你带去，就说随便他挑中我哪一个女儿，我都心甘情愿地答应他把她娶过去；不过，我在信上得特别替小丽萃吹嘘几句。”','“我希望你别这么做。丽萃没有一点儿地方胜过别的几个女儿；我敢说，论漂亮，她抵不上吉英一半；论性子，好抵不上丽迪雅一半。你可老是偏爱她。”“她们没有哪一个值得夸奖的，”他回答道；“他们跟人家的姑娘一样，又傻，又无知；倒是丽萃要比她的几个姐妹伶俐些。”','“我的好老爷，你怎么舍得这样糟蹋自己的新生亲生女儿？你是在故意叫我气恼，好让你自己得意吧。你半点儿也不体谅我的神经衰弱。”','“你真错怪了我，我的好太太。我非常尊重你的神经。它们是我的老朋友。至少在最近二十年以来，我一直听道你慎重其事地提到它们。”','“啊！你不知道我怎样受苦呢！”','“不过我希望你这毛病会好起来，那么，象这种每年有四千镑收入的阔少爷，你就可以眼看着他们一个个搬来做你的邻居了。”','“你既然不愿意去拜访他们，即使有二十个搬了来，对我们又有什么好处！”','“放心吧，我的好太太，等到有了二十个，我一定去一个个拜望到。”','班纳特先生真是个古怪人，他一方面喜欢插科打浑，爱挖苦人，同时又不拘言笑，变幻莫测，真使他那位太太积二十三年之经验，还摸不透他的性格。太太的脑子是很容易加以分析的。她是个智力贫乏、不学无术、喜怒无常的女人，只要碰到不称心的事，她就以为神经衰弱。她生平的大事就是嫁女儿；她生平的安慰就是访友拜客和打听新闻。','Chapter 2','MR. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, ”I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.” ','”We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, ”since we are not to visit.” ','”But you forget, mama,” said Elizabeth, ”that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.” ','”I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.” ','”No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; ”and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.” ','Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. ','”Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for heavens sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” ','”Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; ”she times them ill.” ','”I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. ','”When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?” ','”To-morrow fortnight.” ','”Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, ”and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.” ','”Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.” ','”Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?” ','”I honour your circumspection. A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.” ','The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, ”Nonsense, nonsense!” ','”What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. ”Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.” ','Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how. ','”While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, ”let us return to Mr. Bingley.” ','”I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife. ','”I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.” ','The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. ','”How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.” ','”Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. ','”What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was shut. ”I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.” ','”Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, ”I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, Im the tallest.” ','The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennets visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. ','班纳特先生尽管在自己太太面前自始至终都说是不想去拜访彬格莱先生，事实上一直都打算去拜访他，而且还是跟第一批人一起去拜访他的。等到他去拜访过以后，当天晚上太太才知道实情。这消息透露出来的经过是这样的－－他看到第二个女儿在装饰帽子，就突然对她说： ','“我希望彬格莱先生会喜欢你这顶帽子，丽萃。”','她母亲气愤愤地说：“我们既然不预备去看彬格莱先生，当然就无从知道他喜欢什么。”','“可是你忘啦，妈妈，”伊丽莎白说，“我们将来可以在跳舞会上碰到他的，郎格太太不是答应过把他介绍给我们吗？”','“我不相信郎格太太肯这么做。她自己有两个亲侄女。她是个自私自利、假仁假义的女人，我睢不起她。”','“我也瞧不起她，”班纳特先生说；“你倒不指望她来替你效劳，这叫我听到高兴。”','班纳特太太没有理睬他，可是忍不住气，便骂起女儿来。','“别那么咳个不停，吉蒂，看老天爷份上吧！稍许体谅一下我的神经吧。你简直叫我的神经要胀裂啦。”','“吉蒂真不知趣，”她的父亲说；“咳嗽也不知道拣个时候。”','“我又不是故意咳着玩儿。”吉蒂气恼地回答道。','“你们的跳舞会定在那一天开，丽萃？”','“从明天算起，还得再过两个星期。”','“唔，原来如此，”她的母亲嚷道，“郎格太太可要挨到开跳舞会的前一天才能赶回来；那么，她可来不及把他介绍给你们啦，她自己也还不认识他呢。”','“那么，好太太，你正可以占你朋友的上风，反过来替她介绍这位贵人啦。”','“办不到，我的好老爷，办不到，我自己还不认识他呢；你怎么可以这样嘲笑人？”','“我真佩服你想得这般周到。两个星期的认识当然谈不上什么。跟一个人相处了两个星期，不可能就此了解他究竟是怎样一个人。不过，要是我们不去尝试尝试，别人可少不了要尝试的。话说到底，郎格太太和她的侄女一定不肯错过这个良机。因此，要是你不愿意办这件事，我自己来办好了，反正她会觉得这是我们对她的一片好意。”','女儿们都对父亲瞪着眼。班纳特太太只随口说了声：“毫无意思！”','“你怎么这样大惊小怪！”他嚷道。“你以为替人家效点儿劳介绍是毫无意思的事吗？你这样的说法我可不大同意。你说呢，曼丽？我知道你是个有独到见解的少女，读的书都是皇皇巨著，而且还要做札记。”','曼丽想说几句有见识的话可又不知道怎么说才好。','于是班纳特先生接下去说：“让曼丽仔细想一想再发表意见吧，我们还是重新来谈谈彬格莱先生。”','“我就讨厌谈彬格莱先生，”他的太太嚷起来了。','“遗憾得很，你竟会跟我说这种话；你怎么不早说呢？要是今天上午听到你这样说，那我当然不会去拜访他啦。这真叫不凑巧。现在既然拜访也拜访过了，我们今后就少不了要结交这个朋友。“','果然不出他所料，娘儿们一听此说，一个个都大这惊异，尤其是班纳特太太，比谁都惊异得厉害；不过，这样欢天喜地地喧嚷了一阵以后，她便当众宣布，说这件事她早就料到的。','“你真是个好心肠的人，我的好老爷！我早就知道你终究会给我说服的。你既然疼爱自己的女儿，当然就不会把这样一个朋友不放在心上。我真太高兴了！你这个玩笑开得真太有意思，谁想到你竟会今天上午去拜访他，而且到现在一字不提。”','“吉蒂，现在你可以放心大胆地咳嗽啦，”班纳特先生一面说，一面走出房间，原来他看到太太那样得意忘形，不免觉得有些厌恶。门一关上，班纳特太太便对她的几个女儿说“孩子们，你们的爸爸真太好了，我不知道你们怎样才能报答他的恩典；再说，你们还应该好好报答我一番呢。老实跟你们说吧，我们老夫妻活到这么一把年纪了，哪儿有兴致天天去交朋结友；可是为了你们，我们随便什么事都乐意去做。丽迪雅，乖宝贝，虽然你年纪最小，开起跳舞会来，彬格莱先生或许就偏偏要跟你跳呢。”','“噢！”丽迪雅满不在乎地说。','“我才不当它一回事。年纪虽然是我最小，个儿算我顶高。”','于是她们一方面猜测那位贵人什么时候会来回拜班纳特先生，一方面盘算着什么时候请他来吃饭，就这样把一个晚上的工夫在闲谈中度过去了。','Chapter 3','NOT all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingleys heart were entertained. ”If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, ”and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.” ','In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennets visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. ','An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a large number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the oldest, and another young man. ','Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. ','Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. ','Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it. ','”Come, Darcy,” said he, ”I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.” ','”I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” ','”I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, ”for a kingdom! Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly pretty.” ','”You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. ','”Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” ','”Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, ”She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.” ','Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous. ','The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear. ','”Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, ”we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger --” ','”If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently, ”he would not have danced half so much! For Gods sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!” ','”Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, ”I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hursts gown --” ','Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. ','”But I can assure you,” she added, ”that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.” ','尽管班纳特太太有了五个女儿帮腔，向她丈夫问起彬格莱先生这样那样，可是丈夫的回答总不能叫她满意。母女们想尽办法对付他－－赤裸裸的问句，巧妙的设想，离题很远的猜测，什么办法都用到了；可是他并没有上她们的圈套。最后她们迫不得已，只得听取邻居卢卡斯太太的间接消息。她的报道全是好话。据说威廉爵士很喜欢他。他非常年轻，长得特别漂亮，为人又极其谦和，最重要的一点是，他打算请一大群客人来参加下次的舞会。这真是再好也没有的事；喜欢跳舞是谈情说爱的一个步骤；大家都热烈地希望去获得彬格莱先生的那颗心。 ','“我只要能看到一个女儿在尼日斐花园幸福地安了家，”班纳特太太对她的丈夫说，“看到其他几个也匹配得这样门当户对，此生就没有别的奢望了。”','不到几天功夫，彬格莱先生上门回拜班纳特先生，在他的书房里跟他盘桓了十分钟左右。他久仰班纳特先生几位小姐的年轻美貌，很希望能够见见她们；但是他只见到了她们的父亲。倒是小姐们比他幸运，他们利用楼上的窗口，看清了他穿的是蓝外套，骑的是一匹黑马。','班府上不久就发请贴请他吃饭；班纳特太太已经计划了好几道菜，每道菜都足以增加她的体面，说明她是个会当家的贤主妇，可是事不凑巧，彬格莱先生第二天非进城不可，他们这一番盛意叫他无法领情，因此回信给他们，说是要迟一迟再说。班纳特太太大为不安。她想，此人刚来到哈福德郡，怎么就要进城有事，于是她开始担心思了；照理他应该在尼日斐花园安安定定住下来，看现在的情形，莫不是他经常都得这样东漂西泊，行踪不定？亏得卢卡斯太太对她说，可能他是到伦敦去邀请那一大群客人来参加舞会，这才使她稍许减除了一些顾虑。外面马上就纷纷传说彬格莱先生并没有带来十二个女宾，仅仅只带来六个，其中五个是他自己的姐妹，一个是表姐妹，这个消息才使小姐们放了心。后来等到这群贵客走进舞场的时候，却一共只有五个人－－彬格莱先生，他的两个姐妹，姐夫，还有另外一个青年。','彬格莱先生仪表堂堂，大有绅士风度，而且和颜悦色，没有拘泥做作的气习。他的姐妹也都是些优美的女性，态度落落大方。他的姐夫赫斯脱只不过像个普通绅士，不大引人注目，但是他的朋友达西却立刻引起全场的注意，因为他身材魁伟，眉清目秀，举止高贵，于是他进场不到五分钟，大家都纷纷传说他每年有一万磅的收入。男宾们都称赞他的一表人才，女宾们都说他比彬格莱先生漂亮得多。人们差不多有半个晚上都带着爱慕的目光看着他。最后人们才发现他为人骄傲，看不起人，巴结不上他，因此对他起了厌恶的感觉，他那众望所归的极盛一时的场面才黯然失色。他既然摆起那么一副讨人嫌惹人厌的面貌，那么，不管他在德比郡有多大的财产，也挽救不了他，况且和他的朋友比起来，他更没有什么大不了。','彬格莱先生很快就熟悉了全场所有的主要人物。他生气勃勃，为人又不拘泥，每一场舞都可以少不了要跳。使他气恼的是，舞会怎么散场得这样早。他又谈起他自己要在尼日斐花园开一次舞会。他这些可爱的地方自然会引起人家对他发生好感。他跟他的朋友是多么显著的对照啊！达西先生只跟赫斯脱太太跳了一次舞，跟彬格莱小姐跳了一次舞，此外就在室内踱来踱去，偶而找他自己人谈谈，人家要介绍他跟别的小姐跳舞，他怎么也不肯。大家都断定他是世界上最骄傲，最讨人厌的人，希望他不要再来。其中对他反感最厉害的是班纳特太太，她对他的整个举止都感到讨厌，而且这种讨厌竟变本加厉，形成了一种特殊的气愤，因为他得罪了他的一个女儿。','由于男宾少，伊丽莎白·班纳特有两场舞都不得不空坐。达西先生当时曾一度站在她的身旁，彬格莱先生特地歇了几分钟没有跳舞，走到他这位朋友跟前，硬要他去跳，两个人谈话给她听到了。','“来吧，达西，”彬格莱说，“我一定要你跳。我不愿看到你独个儿这么傻里傻气地站在这儿。还是去跳舞吧。”','“我绝对不跳。你知道我一向多么讨厌跳舞，除非跟特别熟的人跳。在这样的舞会上跳舞，简直叫人受不了。你的姐妹们都在跟别人跳，要是叫舞场里别的女人跟我跳，没有一个不叫我活受罪的。”','“我可不愿意象你那样挑肥拣瘦，”彬格莱嚷道，“随便怎么我也不愿意；不瞒你说，我生平没有见过今天晚上这么许多可爱的姑娘；你瞧，其中几位真是美貌绝伦。”','“你当然罗，舞场上唯一的一位漂亮姑娘在跟你跳舞！”达西先生说，一面望着班府上年纪最大的一位小姐。','“噢！我从来没有见过这么美丽的一个尤物！可是她的一个妹妹就坐在你后面，她也很漂亮，而且我敢说，她也很讨人爱。让我来请我的舞伴给你们介绍一下吧。”','“你说的是哪一位？”他转过身来，朝着伊丽莎白望了一会儿，等她也看见了他，他才收回自己的目光，冷冷的说：“她还可以，但还没有漂亮到打动我的心，眼前我可没有兴趣去抬举那些受到别人冷眼看待的小姐。你还是回到你的舞伴身边去欣赏她的笑脸吧，犯不着把时间浪费在我的身上。”','彬格莱先生依了达西先生的话走开以后，达西自己也走开了。伊丽莎白依旧坐在那里，对达西先生委实没有甚好感。不过她却满有兴致地把这段偷听到的话去讲给她的朋友听，因为她的个性活泼调皮，遇到任何可笑的事情都会感到兴趣。','班府上全家上这一个晚上大致都过得很高兴。大小姐蒙彬格莱先生邀她跳了两次舞，而且这位贵人的姐妹们都对她另眼相看。班太太看到尼日斐花园的一家人都这么喜爱她的大女儿，觉得非常得意。吉英跟她母亲一样得意，只不过没有象她母亲那样声张。伊丽莎白也为吉英快活。曼丽曾听到人们在彬格莱小姐面前提到她自己，说她是邻近一带最有才干的姑娘；咖苔琳和丽迪雅运气最好，没有那一场舞缺少舞伴，这是她们每逢开舞会时唯一关心的一件事。母女们高高兴兴地回到她们所住的浪搏恩村（她们算是这个村子里的旺族），看见班纳特先生还没有睡觉。且说这位先生平常只要捧上一本书，就忘了时间，可是这次他没有睡觉，却是因为他极想知道大家朝思暮想的这一盛会，经过情形究竟如何。他满以为他太太对那位贵客一定很失望，但是，他立刻就发觉事实并非如此。“噢！我的好老爷，”她一走进房间就这么说，“我们这一个晚上过得太快活了，舞会太好了。你没有去真可惜。吉英那么吃香，简直是无法形容。什么人都说她长得好；彬格莱先生认为她很美，跟她跳了两场舞！你光想想这一点看吧，亲爱的；他确实跟她跳了两场！全场那么多女宾，就只有她一个人蒙受了他两次邀请。他头一场舞是邀请卢卡斯小姐跳的。我看到他站到她身边去，不禁有些气恼！不过，他对她根本没意思，其实，什么人也不会对她有意思；当吉英走下舞池的时候，他可就显得非常着迷了。他立刻打听她的姓名，请人介绍，然后邀她跳下一场舞。他第三场舞是跟金小姐跳的，第四场跟玛丽雅·卢卡斯跳，第五场又跟吉英跳，第六场是跟丽萃跳，还有‘布朗谢’。”','“要是他稍许体谅我一点，”她的丈夫不耐烦地叫起来了，“他就不会跳这么多，一半也不会！天哪，不要提他那些舞伴了吧。噢！但愿他头一场舞就跳得脚踝扭了筋！”','“噢！亲爱的，”班纳特太太接下去说，“我非常喜欢他。他真太漂亮啦！他的姐妹们也都很讨人喜欢。我生平没有看见过任何东西比她们的衣饰更讲究。我敢说，赫斯脱太太衣服上的花边－－”说到这里又给岔断了。','班纳特先生不愿意听人谈到衣饰。她因此不得不另找话题，于是就谈到达西先生那不可一世的傲慢无礼的态度，她的措辞辛辣刻薄，而又带几分夸张。','“不过我可以告诉你，”她补充道，“丽萃不中他的意，这对丽萃并没有什么可惜，因为他是个最讨厌、最可恶的人不值得去奉承他。那么高傲，那么自大，叫人不可容忍！他一会儿走到这里，一会儿走到那里，把自己看得那么了不起！还要嫌人家不够漂亮，配不上跟他跳舞呢！要是你在场的话，你就可以好好地教训他一顿。我厌恶透了那个人。”','Chapter 4','WHEN Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. ”He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, ”sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! -- so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” ','”He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, ”which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.” ','”I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.” ','”Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other women in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.” ','”Dear Lizzy!” ','”Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.” ','”I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.” ','”I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough; -- one meets it every where. But to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every bodys character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone. And so, you like this mans sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.” ','”Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.” ','Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced. Their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies, not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. ','Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. -- Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. ','His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. ','Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. -- Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcys regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence. ','The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. ','Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. ','吉英本来并不轻易赞扬彬格莱先生，可是当她和伊丽莎白两个人在一起的时候，她就向她的妹妹倾诉衷曲，说她自己多么爱慕他。 ','“他真是一个典型的好青年，”她说，“有见识，有趣味，人又活泼；我从来没有见过他那种讨人喜欢的举止！那么大方，又有十全十美的教养！”','“他也长得很漂亮，”伊丽莎白回答道，“一个年轻的男人也得弄得漂亮些，除非办不到，那又当别论。他真够得上一个完美无瑕的人。”','“他第二次又来请我跳舞，我真高兴死了。我真想不到他会这样抬举我。”','“你真的没想到吗？我倒替你想到了。不过，这正是我和你大不相同的地方。你遇到人家抬举你，总是受宠若惊，我就不是这样。他第二次再来请你跳舞，这不是再自然不过的事吗？你比起舞场里任何一位小姐都要漂亮得不知多少倍，他长了眼睛自然会看得出。他向你献殷勤你又何必感激。说起来，他的确很可爱，我也不反对你喜欢他。不过你以前可也喜欢过很多蠢货啊。”','“我的亲丽萃！”','“唔！我知道，你总是太容易发生好感。你从来看不出人家的短处。在你眼睛里看来，天下都是好人，你都看得顺眼。我生平从来没听见你说人家的坏话。”','“我倒希望不要轻易责难一个人，可是我一向都是想到什么就说什么。”','“我知道你是这样的，我对你感到奇怪的也就是这种地方。凭你这样一个聪明人。为什么竟会忠厚到看不出别人的愚蠢和无聊！你走遍天下，到处都可以遇到伪装坦白的人。可是，这可只有你做得到。那么，你也喜欢那位先生的姐妹们吗？她们的风度可比不上他呀。”','“初看上去的确比不上。不过跟她们攀谈起来，就觉得她们也都是些讨人喜欢的女人。听说彬格莱小姐将要跟她兄弟住在一起，替他料埋家务；她要不是个好邻居，那才怪呢。”','伊丽莎白听着姐姐的话，嘴上一声不响，心里可并不信服。她比她姐姐的观察力来得敏锐，脾气她没有姐姐那么好惹，因此提到彬家姐妹，她只要想想她们在跳舞场里的那种举止，就知道她们并不打算要讨一般人的好。而且她胸有城府，决不因为人家等待她好就改变主张，她不会对她们发生多大好感的。事实上她们都是些非常好的小姐；她们并不是不会谈笑风生，问题是在要碰到她们高兴的时候；她们也不是不会待人和颜悦色，问题在于她们是否乐意这样做。可惜的是，她们一味骄傲自大。她们都长得很漂亮，曾经在一个上流的专科学校里受过教育，有两万镑的财产，花起钱来总是挥霍无度，爱结交有身价地位的人，因此才造成了她们在各方面都自视甚高，不把别人放在眼里。她们出生于英格兰北部的一个体面家族。她们对自己的出身记得很牢，可是却几乎忘了她们兄弟的财产以及她们自己的财产都是做生意赚来的。','彬格莱先生从他的父亲那儿只承继了一笔将近十万镑的遗产。他父亲生前本来打算购置些田产，可惜没有了却心愿就与世长辞了。彬格莱先生同样有这个打算，并且一度打算就在自己故乡购置，不过目前他既然有了一幢很好的房子，而且有庄园听他任意使用，于是那些了解他性格的人都说，象他这样一个随遇而安的人，下半辈子恐怕就在尼日斐花园度过，购置田产的事又要留给下一代去做了。他的姐妹们倒反而替他着急，希望早些购置产业；不过尽管他现在仅仅是以一个租户的身分在这儿住了下来，彬格莱小姐还是非常愿意替他掌管家务，再说那位嫁了个穷措大的赫斯脱太太，每逢上弟弟这儿来作客，依旧象是到了自己家里一样。当时彬格莱先生成年还不满两个年头，只因为偶然听到人家推荐尼日斐花园的房子，他便来到这儿看看。他里里外外看了半个钟头，地段和几间主要的房间都很中他的意，加上房东又把那幢房子大大赞美了一番，那番话对他也是正中下怀，于是他就当场租了下来。他和达西虽然性格大不相同，彼此之间友谊却始终如一。达西所以喜欢彬格莱，是因为彬格莱为人温柔敦厚、坦白直爽，尽管个性方面和他自己极端相反，而他自己也从来不曾觉得自己的个性有什么不完美的地方。达西很器重彬格莱，因此彬格莱对他极其信赖，对他的见解也推崇备至。在智力方面讲，达西比他强──这并不是说彬格莱笨，而是说达西聪明些。达西为人兼有傲慢、含蓄和爱挑剔的性子，他虽说受过良好的教养，可是他的风度总不受人欢迎。从这一方面讲，他的朋友可比他高明了。彬格莱无论走到哪儿，一定都会讨人喜欢，达西却始终得罪人。','从他俩谈起麦里屯舞会的态度来看，就足见两人性格的不同。彬格莱说，他生平从来没有遇到过什么人比这儿的人更和蔼，也没有遇到过什么姑娘比这儿的姑娘更漂亮；在他看来，这儿每个人都极其和善，极其殷勤，不拘礼，不局促，他一下子就觉得和全场的人都相处得很熟；讲起班纳特小姐，他想象不出人间会有一个比她更美丽的天使。至于达西，他总觉得他所看到的这些人既不美，又谈不上风度，没有一个人使他感兴趣，也没有一个人对他献殷勤，博取他的欢心。他承认班纳特小姐是漂亮的，可惜她笑得太多。赫斯脱太太姐妹同意他这种看法──可是她们仍然羡慕她，喜欢她，说她是个甜姐儿，她们并不反对跟她这样的一位小姐做个深交。班纳特小姐就这样成为一个甜姐儿了，她们的兄弟听到了这番赞美，便觉得今后可以爱怎么样想她就怎么样想她了。','Chapter 5','WITHIN a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. Jamess had made him courteous. Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. -- They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeths intimate friend. ','That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate. ','”You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. ”You were Mr. Bingleys first choice.” ','”Yes; -- but he seemed to like his second better.” ','”Oh! -- you mean Jane, I suppose -- because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her -- indeed I rather believe he did -- I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson.” ','”Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinsons asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question -- ”Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.”” ','”Upon my word! -- Well, that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if -- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.” ','”My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said Charlotte. ”Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? -- Poor Eliza! -- to be only just tolerable.” ','”I beg you would not put it into Lizzys head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.” ','”Are you quite sure, Maam? -- is not there a little mistake?” said Jane. -- ”I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.” ','”Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; -- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.” ','”Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, ”that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is remarkably agreeable.” ','”I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.” ','”I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, ”but I wish he had danced with Eliza.” ','”Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, ”I would not dance with him, if I were you.” ','”I believe, Maam, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.” ','”His pride,” said Miss Lucas, ”does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.” ','”That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, ”and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.” ','”Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, ”is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” ','”If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, ”I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.” ','”Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; ”and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.” ','The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit. ','距离浪博恩不远的地方，住着一家人家，这就是威廉·卢卡斯爵士府上。班纳特府上跟他们特别知已。爵士从前是在麦里屯做生意起家发迹的，曾在当市长的任内上书皇上，获得了一个爵士头衔；这个显要的身份使他觉得太荣幸，从此他就讨厌做生意，讨厌住在一个小镇上，于是歇了生意，告别小镇，带着家属迁到那离开麦里屯大约一英里路的一幢房子里去住，从那时候起就把那地方叫做卢家庄。他可以在这儿自得其乐，以显要自居，而且，既然摆脱了生意的纠缠，他大可以一心一意地从事社交活动。他尽管以自己的地位欣然自得，却并不因此而目空一切，反而对什么人都应酬得非常周到。他生来不肯得罪人，待人接物总是和蔼可亲，殷勤体贴，而且自从皇上觐见以来，更加彬彬有礼。卢卡斯太太是个很善良的女人，真是班纳特太太一位宝贵的邻居。卢府上有好几个孩子。大女儿是个明理懂事的年轻小姐，年纪大约二十六七岁，她是伊丽莎白的要好朋友。且说卢府上几位小姐跟班府上几位小姐这回非要见见面，谈谈这次跳舞会上的事业不可。于是在开完了跳舞会的第二天上午，卢府上的小姐们到浪博恩来跟班府上的小姐交换意见。 ','班纳特太太一看见卢卡斯小姐，便客客气气，从容不迫地说：“那天晚上全靠你开场开得好，你做了彬格莱先生的第一个意中人。”','“是呀；可是他喜欢的倒是第二个意中人。”','“哦，我想你是说吉英吧，因为他跟她跳了两次。看起来，他是真的爱上她呢──我的确相信他是真的──我听到了一些话──可是我弄不清究竟──我听到了一些有关鲁宾逊先生的话。”','“说不定你指的是我喻听到他和鲁宾逊先生的谈话吧；我不是跟你说过了吗？鲁宾逊先生问他喜欢不喜欢我们麦里屯的跳舞会，问他是否觉得到场的女宾们中间有许多人很美，问他认为哪一个最美？他立刻回答了最后一个问题：“毫无问题是班纳特家的大小姐最美。关于这一点，人们决不会有别的看法。”','“一定的！说起来，那的确成了定论啦──看上去的确象是──不过，也许会全部落空呢，你知道。”','“我偷听到的话比你听到的要更有意思了，伊丽莎，”夏绿蒂说。“达西先生的话没有他朋友的话中听，可不是吗？可怜的伊丽莎！他不过认为她还可以！”','“我请求你别叫丽萃想起了他这种无礼的举动又生起气来；他是那么讨厌的一个人，被他看上了才叫倒霉呢。郎格太太告诉我说，昨儿晚上他坐在她身边有半个钟头，可是始终不开口。”','“你的话靠得住吗，妈妈？──一点儿没说错吗？”吉英说。“我清清楚楚看到达西先生跟她说话的。”','“嘿──那是后来她问起他喜欢不喜欢尼日斐花园，他才不得不已敷衍了她一下；可是据她说，他似乎非常生气，好象怪她不该跟她说话似的。”','“彬格莱小姐告诉我，”吉英说，“他从来不爱多说话，除非跟知已的朋友们谈谈。他对待知已朋友非常和蔼可亲。”','“我跟本不相信这种话，要是他果真和蔼可亲，就该跟郎格太太说话啦。可是这里面的奥妙是可想而知的，大家都说他非常骄傲，他所以没跟郎格太太说话，或许是因为听到朗格太太连马车也没有一部，临时雇了车子来参加跳舞会吧。”','“他没跟郎格太太说话，我倒不计较，”卢卡斯小姐说，“我只怪他当时没跟伊丽莎跳舞。”','“丽萃，假如我是你，”她母亲说，“我下次偏不跟他跳舞。”','“妈妈，我相信我可以万无一失地向你保证，我怎么也不跟他跳舞呢。”','“他虽然骄傲，”卢卡斯小姐说，“可不象一般人的骄傲那样使我生气，因为他的骄傲还勉强说得过去。这么优秀的一个青年，门第好，又有钱，样样都比人家强，也难怪他要自以为了不起，照我的说法，他有权利骄傲。”','“这倒是真话，”伊丽莎白回答道，“要是他没有触犯我的骄傲，我也很容易原谅他的骄傲。”','“我以为骄傲是一般人的通病，”曼丽说。她觉得自己的见解很高明，因此提高了谈话的兴致。“从我所读过的许多书看来，我相信那的确是非常普遍的一种通病，人性特别容易趋向于这方面，简直谁都不免因为自己具有了某种品质而自命不凡。虚荣与骄傲是截然不同的两件事，尽管字面上常常当作同义词用，一个人可以骄傲而不虚荣。骄傲多半不外乎我们对我们自己的估价，虚荣却牵涉到我们希望别人对我们的看法。”卢家一个小哥儿（他是跟他姐姐们一起来的）忽然说道：“要是我也像达西先生那么有钱，我真不知道会骄傲到什么地步呢。我要养一群猎狗，还要每天喝一瓶酒。”班纳特太太说：“那你就喝得太过分啦，要量给我看见了，我就马上夺掉你的酒瓶。”那孩子抗议道，她不应该那样做；她接着又宣布了一遍，说她一定要那样，一场辩论直到客人告别时方才结束。','Chapter 6','THE ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas. ”It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, ”to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely -- a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” ','”But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.” ','”Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Janes disposition as you do.” ','”But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.” ','”Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.” ','”Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, ”where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Janes feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.” ','”Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal.” ','”Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” ','”Well,” said Charlotte, ”I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always contrive to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.” ','”You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.” ','Occupied in observing Mr. Bingleys attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; -- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. ','He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucass, where a large party were assembled. ”What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, ”by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?” ','”That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.” ','”But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.” ','On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, ','”Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?” ','”With great energy; -- but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.” ','”You are severe on us.” ','”It will be her turn soon to be teazed,” said Miss Lucas. ”I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.” ','”You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! -- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body! -- If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucass persevering, however, she added, ”Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, ”There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with -- ”Keep your breath to cool your porridge,” -- and I shall keep mine to swell my song.” ','Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display. ','Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. ','Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began. ','”What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! -- There is nothing like dancing after all. -- I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.” ','”Certainly, Sir; -- and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. -- Every savage can dance.” ','Sir William only smiled. ”Your friend performs delightfully;” he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; -- ”and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.” ','”You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.” ','”Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. Jamess?” ','”Never, sir.” ','”Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?” ','”It is a compliment which I never pay to any place, if I can avoid it.” ','”You have a house in town, I conclude?” ','Mr. Darcy bowed. ','”I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.” ','He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, ','”My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? -- Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. -- You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.” And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William, ','”Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. -- I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.” ','Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. ','”You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.” ','”Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling. ','”He is indeed -- but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?” ','Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley. ','”I can guess the subject of your reverie.” ','”I should imagine not.” ','”You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people! -- What would I give to hear your strictures on them!” ','”Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.” ','Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity, ','”Miss Elizabeth Bennet.” ','”Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. ”I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite? -- and pray when am I to wish you joy?” ','”That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A ladys imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.” ','”Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.” ','He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long. ','浪博恩小姐们不久就去拜访尼是斐花园的小姐们了。人家了照例来回拜了她们。班纳特那种讨人喜爱的举止，使赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐对她愈来愈有好感。尽管班家老太太叫人不可容忍，几个小妹妹也不值得攀谈，可是两位彬格莱小姐却是愿意跟年纪大的两位班小姐作进一步深交，吉英极其喜悦地领受了这份盛意；可是伊丽莎白看出她们对待任何人仍然很高傲，甚至对待吉英也几乎没有两样，因此颇不喜欢她们；不过，她们所以待吉英好，看来多半还是由于她们兄弟爱慕她的缘故。只要你看见他们俩在一起，你就看得出他兄弟确是爱慕她的。伊丽莎白又很清楚地看出吉英一开头就看中了彬格莱先生，不由自主地向他屈服了，而且也可以说是对他喜爱极了。可是她高兴地想道，吉英虽说感情丰富，好在性格很镇定，外表上仍然保持着正常的和颜悦色，那就不会引起那些卤莽人的怀疑，因此他俩的心意也就不会给人察觉了。伊丽莎白曾经跟自己的朋友卢卡斯小姐谈到过这一点。 ','夏绿蒂当时说道：“这种事想瞒过大家，也许是怪有意思的，不过，这样提心吊胆，有时候反而不妙。要是一个女人在她自己心爱的人面前，也用这种技巧遮遮掩掩，不让他知道她对他有意思，那她就可能没有机会博得他的欢心；那么，就是把天下人都蒙在鼓里，也无补于事。男女恋爱大都免不了要借重于双方的感恩图报之心和虚荣自负之感，听其自然是很难成其好事的。恋爱的开头都是随随便便──某人对某人发生点儿好感，本是极其自然的一回事；只可惜没有对方和鼓励而自己就肯没头没脑去钟情的人，简直太少了。女人家十有八九都是心里有一分爱表面上就露出两分。毫无问题，彬格莱喜欢你姐姐；可是你姐姐如果不帮他一把劲，他也许喜欢喜欢她就算了。”','“不过她已经尽心竭力在帮他的忙了。要是我都能看出她对他的好感，而他却看不出，那他未免太蠢了。”','“伊丽莎，你得记住，他可不象你那么懂得吉英的性格。”','“假如一个女人爱上了一个男人，只要女方不故意瞒住男方，男方一定会看得出的。”','“要是男方和女方见面的机会很多，或许他总会看得出。虽然彬格莱和吉英见面的次数相当多，却从来没有在一起接连待上几个钟头，何况他们见起面来，总是跟一些杂七杂八的人在一起，不可能让他们俩畅谈。因此吉英就得时时刻刻留神，一看到有机会可以逗引他，千万不要借过。等到能把他抓到手，再从从容容尽量去谈恋爱还来得及。”','伊丽莎白回答道：“倘使只求嫁一个有钱的男人，你这个办法妙极了，我如果决心找个阔丈夫，或者干脆只要随便找个丈夫就算数，我或许会照你的办法去做。可惜吉英不是这样想法的；她为人处世，就是不愿意使心眼儿。而且，她自己也还拿不准她究竟对她钟情到什么地步，钟情得是否得体。她认识他才不过两个星期。她在麦里屯跟他跳了四次舞；有天上午她在他家里跟他见过一次面，此后又跟他吃过四次晚饭，可是总有别人在一起。就这么点儿来往，叫她怎么能了解他的性格呢。”','“事情并不是你所说的那样。要是她只跟他吃吃晚饭，那她或许只看得出他的饭量好不好；可是你得记住，他们既在一起吃过四顿饭也就是在一起盘恒了四个晚上呀──四个晚上的作用可大着呢。”','“是的；这四个晚上叫他们彼此摸透了一样性格，那就是他们俩都喜欢玩二十一点，不喜欢玩‘康梅司’；讲到别的重要的特点，我看他们彼此之间还了解很少。”','“唔，”夏绿蒂说，“我一心一意祝吉英成功。我以为即使她明天就跟他结婚，她必能获得的幸福，比起她花上一年的时间，研究了他的性格、再去跟他结婚所能获得的幸福，并不见得会少到哪里去。婚姻生活是否幸福，完全是个机会问题。一对爱人婚前脾气摸得非常透，或者脾气非常相同，这并不能保证他们俩就会幸福。他们总是弄到后来距离越来越远，彼此烦恼。你既然得和这个人过一辈子，你最尽量少了解他的缺点。”','“你这番话妙透了，夏绿蒂。不过这种说法未必可靠。你也明知道未必可靠，你自己就不肯那么做。”','伊丽莎白一心只知道谈论彬格莱先生对她姐姐的殷勤，却一点儿没想到她自己已经成了彬格莱那位朋友的意中人。说到达西先生，他开头并不认为她怎么漂亮；他在跳舞会上望着她的时候，并没有带着丝毫的爱慕之意，第二次见面的时候，他也不过用吹毛求疵的眼光去看待她。不过，他尽管在朋友们面前，在自己心里，都说她的面貌一无可取，可是眨下眼的工夫，他就发觉她那双乌黑的眼睛美丽非凡，使她的整个脸蛋儿显得极其聪慧。紧接着这个发现之后，他又在她身上发现了几个同样叫人怄气的地方。他带着挑剔的眼光，发觉她的身段这儿也不匀称，那儿也不匀称，可是他到底不得不承认她体态轻盈，惹人喜爱；虽然他嘴上一口咬定她缺少上流社会的翩翩风采，可是她落落大方爱打趣的作风，又把他迷住了。伊丽莎白完全不明了这些情形，她只觉得达西是个到处不讨人喜欢的男人，何况他曾经认为她不够漂亮不配跟她跳舞。','达西开始希望跟她深交。他为了想要慢慢地跟她攀谈攀谈，因此她跟别人谈话的时候，他问题留神去听。于是，有一次威廉·卢卡斯爵士大请客，他这样的做法当场引起了她的注意。','且说当时伊丽莎白对夏绿蒂说：“你瞧，达西先生是什么意思呢，我跟弗斯脱上校谈话，干吗要他在那儿听？”','“这个问题只有达西先生自己能够回答。”','“要是他再这样，我一定要叫他明白我并不是个糊涂蛋。他挖苦人的本领特别高明，要是我不先给他点颜色看看，我马上就会见他怕啦。”','不到一会儿工夫，达西又走到她身边来了，他表面上虽然并不想跟她们攀谈，卢卡斯小姐却不时怂恿伊丽莎白向他把这个问题正面提出来。伊丽莎白给她这样一激，便立刻转过脸来跟他说：','“达西先生，我刚刚跟弗斯脱上校讲笑话，要他给我们在麦里屯开一次跳舞会，你看我的话是不是说得非常得体？”','“的确说得起劲极了，不过这件事本来就是叫小姐们非常起劲的。”','“你这样说我们，未免太尖刻了些吧。”','“你这一下反而被别人嘲笑了，”卢卡斯小姐说。“我去打开琴，伊丽莎，下文如何，你自个儿明白。”','“你这种朋友真是世上少有！──不管当着什么人的面，总是要我弹琴唱歌！──要是我存心在音乐会上出风头，我真要对你感激不尽。可是宾客们都是听惯了第一流演奏家的，我实在不好意思在他们面前坐下来献憾丑。”话虽如此，怎奈卢卡斯小姐再三要求，她便说道：“好吧，既是非献丑不可，只得献献丑吧。”她又板着脸对达西瞥了一眼，说道：“有名老古话说得好，在场的人当然也晓得这句话：‘留口气吹凉稀饭’；我也就留口气唱歌吧。”','她得表演虽然说不上奇妙绝伦，也还娓娓动听。唱了一两支歌以后，大家要求她再唱几支。她还没来得及回答，她的妹妹曼丽早就急切地接替她坐到钢琴跟前去了。原来在她们几个姐妹之间，就只有曼丽长得不好看，因此她发愤钻研学问，讲究才艺，老是急着要卖弄卖弄自己的本领。','曼丽既没有天才，格调也不高，虽说虚荣心促使她刻苦用功，但是同样也造成了她一脸的女才子气派和自高自大的态度。有了这种气派和态度，即使她的修养再好些也无补于事，何况她不过如此而已。再说伊丽莎白，虽说弹琴弹得并不如她，可是落落大方，没有矫揉造作的气习，因此大家听起来就高兴得多了。曼丽的几位妹妹，本在房间那头和卢家小姐们在一起，正在跟两三个军官跳舞跳得起劲，曼丽奏完了一支很长的协奏曲之后，她们便要求她再奏几支苏格兰和爱尔兰小调，她也高高兴兴地照办了，为的是要博得别人的夸奖和感激。达西先生就站在她们附近。他看到她们就这样度过一个晚上，也不跟别人攀谈攀谈，心里很是生气。他心思很重，威廉·卢卡斯爵士站在他身边他也不知道，最后他才听到爵士这样跟他说：','“达西先生，跳舞对于年轻人是多么可爱的一种娱乐！说来说去，什么都比不上跳舞，我认为这是上流社会里最出色的才艺。”','“当然罗，先生；──而且好就好在跳舞在低等社会里也很风行。哪个野蛮人不会跳舞。”','威廉先生笑了笑没作声。接下来他看见彬格莱也来参加跳舞，便对达西这么说：“你的朋友跳得很不错，我相信你对此道也是驾轻就熟吧，达西先生。“','“你大概在麦里屯看见过我跳舞的吧，先生。”','“见过，不错，而且看得非常高兴。你常到宫里去跳舞吗？”','“从来没去过，先生。”','“你连在宫里都不肯赏脸吗？”','“无论在什么地方，我也不愿意赏这种脸，能避免总是避免。”','“你在城里一定有住宅吧？”','达西先生耸了耸身子。','“我一度想在城里住家，因为我喜欢上流社会；不过我可不敢说伦敦的空气是否适合于卢卡斯太太。”','他停了一会儿，指望对方回答；可是对方根本就懒得回答。不久伊丽莎白朝他们跟前走来，他灵机一动，想乘此献一下殷勤，便对她叫道：','“亲爱的伊丽莎小姐，你干吗不跳舞呀？──达西先生，让我把这位年轻的小姐介绍给你，这是位最理想的舞伴。有了这样一个美人儿做你的舞伴，我想你总不会不跳了吧。”他拉住了伊丽莎白的手，预备往达西面前送，达西虽然极为惊奇，可亦不是不愿意接住那只玉手，却不料伊丽莎白立刻把手缩了回去，好象还有些神色仓皇地对威廉爵士说：','“先生，我的确一点儿也不想跳舞。你可千万别以为我是跑到这边来找舞伴的。”','达西先生非常有礼貌地要求她赏光，跟他跳一场，可是他白白要求了。伊丽莎白下定了决心就不动摇，任凭威廉爵士怎么劝说也没有用。','“伊丽莎小姐，你跳舞跳得那么高明，可是却不肯让我享享眼福，看你跳一场，这未免太说不过去了吧。再说，这位先生虽说平常并不喜欢这种娱乐，可是要他赏我们半个钟头的脸，我相信他也不会不肯的。”','伊丽莎笑着说：“达西先生未免太客气了。”','“他真的太客气了──可是，亲爱的伊丽莎小姐，看他这样求你，你总还会怪他多礼吧。谁不想要象你这样的一个舞伴？”','伊丽莎白笑盈盈地瞟了一眼就转身走开了。她的拒绝并没有使达西觉得难过。达西正在相当高兴地想念着她，恰巧彬格莱小姐走过来招呼他：','“我猜中你现在在幻想些什么。”','“谅你也猜不中。”','“你心里正在想，许多个晚上都是跟这些人在一起无聊度过的，这实在叫人受不了，我跟你颇有同感。我从来不曾这样烦闷过！既枯燥乏味，又吵闹不堪，无聊到了极点。这批人又一个个都自以为了不起！我就想听听你指责他们几句。”','“老实对你说吧，你完全猜错了。我心里想的东西要妙得多呢。我正在玩味着：一个漂亮女人的美丽的眼睛竟会给人这么大的快乐。”','彬格莱小姐立刻把眼睛盯在他的脸上，要他告诉她，究竟是哪位小姐有这种妙处使他这样想入非非。达西先生鼓起极大的勇气回答道：','“伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐。”','“伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐！”彬格莱小姐重复了一遍。“我真感到惊奇。你看中她多久啦？──请你告诉我，我几时可以向你道喜啊？”','“我料到你会问出这样的话来的。女人的想象力真敏捷；从敬慕一跳就跳到爱情，一眨眼的工夫又从爱情跳到结婚。我知道你要预备来向我道喜了。”','“唔，要是你这么一本正经，我就认为这件事百分之百地决定啦。你一定会得到一位有趣的岳母大人，而且当然罗，她会永远在彭伯里跟你待在一起。”','她说得那么得意，他却完全似听非听，她看到他那般镇定自若，便放了心，于是那张利嘴越发滔滔不绝了。','Chapter 7','MR. BENNETS property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mothers fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade. ','The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliners shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters. ','Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingleys large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. ','After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed, ','”From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.” ','Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London. ','”I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, ”that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of any bodys children, it should not be of my own, however.” ','”If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.” ','”Yes -- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.” ','”This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.” ','”My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. -- When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir Williams in his regimentals.” ','”Mama,” cried Lydia, ”my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsons as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarkes library.” ','Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, ','”Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.” ','”It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud. ','”My dear Friend, ','IF you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole days te^te-a`-te^te between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. Yours ever, ','CAROLINE BINGLEY.” ','”With the officers!” cried Lydia. ”I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.” ','”Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, ”that is very unlucky.” ','”Can I have the carriage?” said Jane. ','”No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.” ','”That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, ”if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.” ','”Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingleys chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.” ','”I had much rather go in the coach.” ','”But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?” ','”They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.” ','”But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, ”my mothers purpose will be answered.” ','She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back. ','”This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: ','”My dearest Lizzy, ','I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore throat and head-ache, there is not much the matter with me. ','Yours, &c.” ','”Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, ”if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.” ','”Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long is she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage.” ','Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution. ','”How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, ”as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.” ','”I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want.” ','”Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, ”to send for the horses?” ','”No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.” ','”I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, ”but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.” ','”We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia. -- Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together. ','”If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, ”perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.” ','In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. ','She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. -- That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. -- Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast. ','Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. ','When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters, and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere. ','When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes. ','班纳特先生的全部家当几乎都在一宗产业上，每年可以借此获得两千磅的收入。说起这宗产业，真是他女儿们的不幸。他因为没有儿子，产业得由一个远亲来继承，至于她们母亲的家私，在这样的人家本来也算得上一笔大数目，事实上却还不够补他的损失。班纳特太太的父亲曾经在麦里屯当过律师，给了她四千英镑的遗产。她有过妹妹，嫁给了她爸爸的书记腓力普，妹夫接下来就承继了她爸爸的行业；她还有兄弟，住在伦敦，生意做得很得法。浪博恩这个村子和麦里屯相隔只有一英里路，这么一段距离对于那几位年轻的小姐们是再便利不过的了，她们每星期总得上那儿在三四次，看看她们的姨母，还可以顺便看看那边一家卖女人帽子的商店。两个最小的妹妹咖苔琳和丽迪雅特别倾心于这方面，她们比姐姐们心事要少得多，每当没有更好的消遣办法时，就必定到麦里屯走一遭，消遣消遣美好的晨光，并且晚上也就有了谈助。尽管这村子里通常没有什么新闻可以打听，她们还老是千方百计地从她们姨妈那儿打听到一些。附近地方最近开到了一团民兵，她们的消息来源当然从此就丰富了，真叫她们高兴非凡。这一团人要在这儿驻扎整个冬天，麦里屯就是司令部的所在地。 ','从此她们每次拜访腓力普太太都获得了最有趣的消息。她们每天都会打听到几个军官的名字和他们的社会关系。军官们的住宅不久就让大家知道了，再后来小姐们就直接跟他们搞熟了，腓力普先生一一拜访了那些军官，这真是替她的姨侄女们开辟了一道意想不到的幸福源泉。她们现在开口闭口都离不开那些军官。在这以前，只要提到彬格莱先生的偌大财产，她们的母亲就会眉飞色舞，如今跟军官们的制服对比起来，她们就觉得偌大的财产简直一钱不值了。','一天早晨，班纳特先生听到她们滔滔不绝地谈到这个问题，他不禁冷言冷语地说：','“看你们谈话的神气，我觉得你们真是些再蠢不过的女孩子。以前我不过半信半疑，现在我可完全相信了。”','咖苔琳一听此话，颇感不安，可是并没有回答。丽迪雅却完全没有把爸爸的话当一回事，还是接着说下去，说她自己多么爱慕卡特上尉，还希望当天能够跟他见面，因为他明天上午就要到伦敦去。','班纳特太太对她丈夫说：“我真奇怪，亲爱的，你总喜欢说你自己的孩子蠢。要是我呀，什么人的孩子我都可以看不起，可是我决不会看不起自己的孩子。”','“要是我自己的孩子果真蠢，我决不愿意没有自知之明。”','“你说得不错，可是事实上，她们却一个个都很聪明。”','“我们两个人总算只有在这一点上看法不同。我本来希望你我在任何方面的意见都能融洽一致，可是说起我们的两个小女儿，的确非常蠢；关于这一点，到目前为止，我不得不跟你抱着两样的见解。”','“我的好老爷，你可不能指望这些女孩都跟她们爹妈一样的见识呀。等她们到了我们这么大年纪，她们也许就会跟我们一样，不会再想到什么军官们了。我刻从前有个时期，我也很喜爱‘红制服’───当然，到现在我心里头还喜爱‘红制服’呢；要是有位漂亮的年轻上校，每年有五六千磅的收入，随便向我的哪一个女儿求婚，我决不会拒绝他的；有天晚上在威廉爵士家里，看见弗斯脱上校全副军装，真是一表人材！”','“妈妈，”丽迪雅嚷道，“姨妈说，弗斯脱上校跟卡特尔上尉上琴小姐家里去的次数，不象初来的时候那么勤了；她近来常常看到他们站在‘克拉克借书处’等人。”','班纳特太太正要答话，不料一个小厮走了进来，拿来一封信给班纳特小姐。这是尼是斐花园送来的一封信，小厮等着取回信。班纳特太太高兴得眼睛也闪亮起来。吉英读信的时候，她心急地叫道：“嘿，吉英，谁来的信？信上说些什么？是怎么说的？喂，吉英，赶快看完说给听吧；快点儿呀，宝宝！”','“是彬格莱小姐写来的，”吉英说，一面把信读出来：','我亲爱的的朋友，──要是你不肯发发慈悲，今天光临舍下跟露薏莎和我一同吃饭，我和她两个人就要结下终生的怨仇了。两个女人成天在一块儿谈心，到头来没有不吵架的。接信后希即尽快前来。我的哥和他的几位朋友们都要上军官们那儿去吃饭。','你的永远的朋友珈罗琳·彬格莱','“上军官们那儿去吃饭！”丽迪雅嚷道，“这件事怎么姨妈没告诉我们呢。”','“上别人家去吃饭，”班纳特太太说：“这真是晦气。”','“我可以乘着车子去吗？”吉英部。','“不行，亲爱的，你最好骑着马去。天好象要下雨的样子，下了雨你就可以在那儿过夜。”','“这倒是个好办法，”伊丽莎白说。“只要你拿得准他们不会送她回来。”','“噢，彬格莱先生的马车要送他的朋友到麦里屯去，赫斯脱夫妇又是有车无马。”','“我倒还是愿意乘着马车去。“','“可是，乖孩子，我包管你爸爸匀不出拖车子的马来。──农庄上正要马用，我的好老爷，是不是？”','“农庄上常常要马用，可惜到我手里的时候并不多。”','伊丽莎白说：“可是，如果今天到得你的手里，就如了妈妈的愿了。“','她终于逼得父亲不得不承认──那儿匹拉车子的马已经有了别的用处。于是吉英只得骑着另外一匹马去，母亲送她到门口，高高兴兴地说了许多预祝天气会变坏的话。她果真如愿了；吉英走了不久，就下起大雨来。妹妹们都替她担忧，只有她老人家反而高兴。大雨整个黄昏没有停住。吉英当然无法回来了。','班纳特太太一遍又一遍地说：“真亏我想出了这个好办法！”好象天下雨老师她一手造成的。不过，她的神机妙算究竟造成了多大幸福，她一直到第二天早上才知道。早饭还没吃完，尼日斐花园就打发了人送来一封信给伊丽莎白：','我亲爱的丽萃，──今晨我觉得很不舒服，我想这可能是昨天淋了雨的缘故。承蒙这儿好朋友们的关切，要我等到身体舒适一些才回家来。朋友们再三要请钏斯医生来替我看病，因此，要是你们他上我这儿来过，可别惊讶。我只不过有点儿喉咙痛和头痛，并没有什么大不了的毛病。───姐字。','伊丽莎白读信的时候，班纳特先生对他太太说：“唔，好太太，要是你的女儿得了重病──万一她一病不起──倒也值得安慰呀，因为她是奉了你命令去追求彬格莱先生的。”','“噢！她难道这么一下子就会送命！哪有小伤风就会送命的道理。人家自会把她等候得好好的。只要她待在那儿，包管无事。倘使有车子的话，我也想去看看她。”真正着急的倒是伊丽莎白，她才不管有车无车，决定非去一趟不可。她既然不会骑马，唯一的办法便只有步行。她把自己的打算说了出来。','她妈妈叫道：“你怎么这样蠢！路上这么泥泞，亏你想得出来！等你走到那儿，你那副样子怎么见人。”','“我只要见到吉英就成。”','“丽萃，”她的父亲说，“你的意思是叫我替你弄几匹马来驾马车吗？”','“当然不是这个意思。我不怕步行，只要存心去，这点儿路算得上什么。才不过三英里路。我可以赶回来吃晚饭。”','这时曼丽说道：“你完全是出于一片手足之情，我很佩服，可是你千万不能感情用事，你得有理智一点，而且我觉得尽力也不要尽得过分。“','珈苔琳和丽迪雅同声说道：“我们陪你到麦里屯。”伊丽莎表示赞成，于是三位年轻的小姐就一块儿出发了。','“要是我们赶得快些，”丽迪雅边走边这么说，“或许我们还来得及赶在卡特尔上尉临走以前看看他。”','三姐妹到了麦里屯便分了手；两位妹妹上一个军官太太的家里去，留下伊丽莎白独个儿继续往前走，急急忙忙地大踏步走过了一片片田野，跨过了一道道围栅，跳过了一个个水洼，终于看见了那所屋子。她这时候已经双脚乏力，袜子上沾满了泥污，脸上也累得通红。','她被领进了餐厅，只见他们全家人都在那儿，只有吉英不在场。她一走进门就引起全场人的惊奇。赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐心想，这么一大早，路上又这么泥泞，她竟从三英里路开外赶到这儿来，而且是独个儿赶来的，这事情简直叫人无法相信。伊丽莎白料定她们瞧不起她这种举动。不过事实上她们倒很客气地接待了她，特别是她们的兄弟，不仅是客客气气接待她，而且非常殷勤多礼。达西先生说话不多，赫斯脱先生完全一言不发。达西先生的心里被两种情感弄得七上八下：一方面爱慕她那步行之后的鲜艳的脸色，另方面又怀疑她是否值得为了这么点儿事情独个儿打那么远赶来。至于赫斯脱先生，他一心一意只想要吃早饭。','她问起姐姐的病情如何，可没有得到满意的回答。据说班纳特小姐晚上睡不好，现在虽然已经起床，热度却很高，不能出房门。使伊丽莎白高兴的是，他们马上就把她领到她姐姐那儿去。吉英看到她来，非常高兴，原来她为了不愿意让家里人着急和麻烦，所以信里并没有说明她极其盼望有个亲人来看看她。可是她没有力气多说话，因此，当彬格莱小姐走开以后，剩下她们姐妹俩在一块儿的时候，她只说到她们这儿待她太好了，使她非常感激───除了这些话以外，就没有再说什么。伊丽莎白静悄悄地等候着她。早饭吃过以后，彬格莱家的姐妹也来陪伴她们，伊丽莎白看到她们对吉英那么亲切和祥，便不禁对她们有了好感。医生来检查了病人的症状，说她是重伤风（其实这也是可想而知的），他嘱咐她们要尽力当心，又劝吉英上床去睡觉，并且给她开了几样药。医生的嘱呼立刻照办了，因为病人热度又高了一些，而且头痛得很厉害。伊丽莎白片刻也没有离开她的房间，另外两位小姐也不大走开；男客们都不在家里，其实他们在家里也帮不了什么忙。','正三点的时候，伊丽莎白觉得应该走了，于是勉强向主人家告别。彬格莱小姐要她乘着马车回去，她正打算稍许推辞一下就接受主人的盛意，不料吉英说是舍不得让她走，于是彬格莱小姐便不得不改变了请她坐马车回去的主意，请她在尼日斐花园小住一阵。伊丽莎白感激不尽地答应了。接下来就是差人上浪博恩去，把她在这儿暂住的事情告诉她家里一声，同时叫她家里给她带些衣服来。','Chapter 8','AT five oclock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingleys, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves, and then thought no more of the matter; and their indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike. Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. ','When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no stile, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added, ','”She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.” ','”She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!” ','”Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.” ','”Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; ”but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.” ','”You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley, ”and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.” ','”Certainly not.” ','”To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum.” ','”It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley. ','”I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, ”that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.” ','”Not at all,” he replied; ”they were brightened by the exercise.” -- A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again. ','”I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.” ','”I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.” ','”Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.” ','”That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily. ','”If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, ”it would not make them one jot less agreeable.” ','”But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy. ','To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations. ','With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment. ','”Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; ”that is rather singular.” ','”Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, ”despises cards. She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else.” ','”I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; ”I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.” ','”In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; ”and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.” ','Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded. ','”And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into.” ','Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room. ','”I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, ”that my father should have left so small a collection of books. -- What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!” ','”It ought to be good,” he replied, ”it has been the work of many generations.” ','”And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.” ','”I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these,” ','”Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.” ','”I wish it may.” ','”But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.” ','”With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.” ','”I am talking of possibilities, Charles.” ','”Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.” ','Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game. ','”Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; ”will she be as tall as I am?” ','”I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennets height, or rather taller.” ','”How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite.” ','”It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, ”how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.” ','”All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?” ','”Yes all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens, and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.” ','”Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, ”has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.” ','”Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley. ','”Then,” observed Elizabeth, ”you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished women.” ','”Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.” ','”Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, ”no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.” ','”All this she must possess,” added Darcy, ”and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.” ','”I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.” ','”Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?” ','”I never saw such a woman, I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.” ','Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. ','”Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, ”is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own, and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.” ','”Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, ”there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.” ','Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. ','Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Joness being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of, but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. ','五点钟的时候，主人家两姐妹出去更衣；六点半的时候伊丽莎白被请去吃晚饭。大家都礼貌周全，纷纷来探问吉英的病情，其中尤其是彬格莱先生问得特别关切，这叫伊丽莎白非常愉快，只可惜吉英的病情一些没有好转，因此她无法给人家满意的回答。那姐妹听到这话，便几次三番地说她们是多么担心，说重伤风是多么可怕，又说她们自己多么讨厌生病，──说过了这些话以后就不当它一回事了。伊丽莎白看到她们当吉英不在她们面前的时候就对吉英这般冷淡，于是她本来那种讨厌她们的心理现在又重新滋长起来。的确，她们这家人里面只有她们的兄弟能使她称心满意，你一眼便可以看出他是真的在为吉英担忧，再说他对于伊丽莎白也殷勤和悦到极点。伊丽莎白本以为人家会把她看作一个不速之客，可是有了这份殷勤，她就不这么想了。除他以外，别人都不大理睬她。彬格莱小姐的心在达西先生身上，赫斯脱太太差不多也没有什么两样；再说到赫斯脱先生，他就坐在伊丽莎白身旁，他天生一副懒骨头，活在世上就是为了吃、喝、玩牌，他听到伊丽莎白宁可吃一碟普通的菜而不喜欢吃烩肉，便和她谈不上劲了。 ','伊丽莎白一吃过晚饭就回到吉英那儿去。她一走出饭厅，彬格莱小姐就开始说她的坏话，把她的作风说得坏透了，说她既傲慢又无礼貌，不懂得跟人家攀谈，仪表不佳，风趣索然，人又长得难看。赫斯脱太太也是同样的看法，而且还补充了几句：','“总而言之，她除了跑路的本领以外，没有要样别的长处。她今儿早上那副样子我才永远忘不了呢，简直象个疯子。”','“她的确象个疯子，露薏莎。我简直忍不住要笑出来。她这一趟来得无聊透顶；姐姐伤了点风，干吗要她那么大惊小怪地跑遍了整个村庄？──头发给弄得那么蓬乱，那么邋遢！”','“是呀，还有她的衬裙──可惜你没看到她的衬裙。我绝对不是瞎说，那上面糊上了有足足六英寸泥，她把外面的裙子放低了些，想把来遮盖，可是遮盖不住。”彬格莱先生说：“你形容得并没有过火的地方，露薏莎，可是我并不以为然。我倒觉得伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐今儿早上走进屋来的时候，那种神情风度很不错呢。我并没有看到她的肮脏的衬裙。”','“你一定看到的，达西先生，”彬格莱小姐说，“我想，你总不愿意看到你自己的姐妹弄成那副狼狈样子吧。”','“当然不愿意。“','“无缘无故赶上那么三英里路、五英里路，谁晓得多少英里呢，泥土盖没了踝骨，而且是孤孤单单的一个人！她这究竟是什么意思？我看她十足表现了没有家教的野态，完全是乡下人不懂礼貌的轻狂。“','彬格莱先生说：“那正说明了她的手足情深，真是好极了。”','彬格莱小姐死样怪气地说：“达西先生，我倒担心，她这次的冒失行为，会影响你对她那双美丽的眼睛的爱慕吧？”','达西回答道：“一点儿影响也没有，她跑过了这趟路以后，那双眼睛更加明亮了。”说完这句话，屋子里稍许沉默了一会儿，然后赫斯脱太太又开口说话：','“我非常关心吉英·班纳特──她倒的确是位可爱的姑娘──我诚心诚意地希望她好好儿攀门亲事。只可惜遇到那样的父母，加上还有那么些下流的亲戚，我怕她没有什么指望了。”','“我不是听你说过，她有个姨爹在麦里屯当律师吗？”','“是呀；她们还有个舅舅住在齐普赛附近。”','“那真妙极了，”她的妹妹补充了一句，于是姐妹俩都纵情大笑。','彬格莱一听此话，便大叫起来：“即使她们有多得数不清的舅舅，可以把整个齐普赛都塞满，也不能把她们讨人喜爱的地方减损分毫。”','“可是，她们倘使想嫁给有地位的男人，机会可就大大减少了，”达西回答道。','彬格莱先生没有理睬为句话；他的姐妹们却听得非常得意，于是越发放肆无忌地拿班纳特小姐的微贱的亲戚开玩笑，开了老半天。','不过她们一离开了饭厅，就重新做出百般温柔体贴的样子，来到吉英房间里，一直陪着她坐到喝咖啡的时候。吉英的病还不见好转，伊丽莎白寸步不离地守着她，一直到黄昏，看见她睡着了，才放下了心，觉得自己应该到楼下去一趟（虽说她并不乐意下楼去）。走进客厅，她发觉大家正在玩牌，大家当时立刻邀她也来玩，可是她恐怕他们输赢很大，便谢绝了，只推说放心不下姐姐，一会儿就得上楼去，她可以拿本书来消消遣遣。赫斯脱先生惊奇地朝她望了一下。','“你宁可看书，不要玩牌吗？”他说。“这真是少有。”','彬格莱小姐说：“伊丽莎·班纳特小姐瞧不起玩牌，她是个了不起的读书人，对别的事都不感到乐趣。”','伊丽莎白嚷道：“这样的夸奖我不敢当，这样的责备我也不敢当，我并不是什么了不起的读书人，很多东西我都感到乐趣。”','彬格莱先生说：“我断定乐意照料你自己的姐姐，但愿她快些复元，那你就会更加快活了。”','伊丽莎白从心底里感激他，然后走到一张放了几本书的桌子跟前。他立刻要另外拿些书来给她──把他书房里所有的书都拿来。“要是我的藏书多一些就好啦，无论是为你的益处着想，为我自己的面子着想；可是我是个懒鬼，藏书不多，读过的就更少了。”伊丽莎白跟他说，房间里那几本书尽够她看了。','彬格莱小姐说：“我很奇怪，爸爸怎么只遣留下来了这么几本书。──达西先生，你在彭伯里的那个藏书室真是好极了！”','达西说：“那有什么稀奇。那是好几代的成绩啊。”','“你自己又添置了不少书，只看见你老是在买书。”','“我有现在这样的日子过，自然不好意思疏忽家里的藏书室。“','“疏忽！我相信凡是能为你那个高贵的地方啬主观的东西，你一件也没疏忽过。──查尔斯，以后你自己建筑住宅的时候，我只希望有彭伯里一半那么美丽就好了。”','“但愿如此。”','“可是我还要竭力奉劝你就在那儿附近购买房产，而且要拿彭伯里做个榜样。全英国没有哪一个郡比德比郡更好了。”','“我非常高兴那么办。我真想干脆就把彭伯里买下来，只要达西肯卖。”','“我是在谈谈可能办到的事情，查尔斯。”','“珈罗琳，我敢说，买下彭伯里比仿照彭伯里的式样造房子，可能性更大些。”伊丽莎白听这些话听得出了神，弄得没心思看书了，索性把书放在一旁，走到牌桌跟前，坐在彬格莱先生和他的妹妹之间，看他们斗牌。','这时彬格莱小姐又问达西：“从春天到现在，达西长高了很多吧？她将来会长到我这么高吧？”','“我想会吧。她现在大概有伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐那么高了，恐怕还要高一点。”','“我直想再见见她！我从来没碰到过这么使我喜爱的人。模样儿那么好，又那样懂得礼貌，小小的年纪就出落得多才多艺，她的钢琴真弹得高明极了。”','彬格莱先生说：“这真叫我惊奇，年轻的姑娘们怎么一个个都有那么大的能耐，把自己锻炼和多才多艺。”','“一个个年轻的姑娘们都是多才多艺！亲受的查尔斯，你这话是什么意思呀？”','“是的，我认为一个个都是那样。她们都会装饰台桌，点缀屏风，编织钱袋。我简直就没有见过哪一位不是样样都会，而且每逢听人谈起一个年轻姑娘，，没有哪一次不听说她是多才多艺的。”*','达西说：“你这一套极其平凡的所谓才艺，倒是千真万确。多少女人只不过会编织钱袋，点缀屏风，就享有了多才多艺的美名；可是我却不能同意你对一般妇女的估价。我不敢说大话；我认识很多女人，而真正多才多艺的实在不过半打。”','“我也的确不敢说大话，”彬格莱小姐说。','伊丽莎白说：“那么，在你的想象中，一个多才多艺的妇女应该包括很多条件啦。”','“不错，我认为应该包括很多条件。”','“噢，当然罗，”他的忠实助手叫起来了，“要是一个妇女不能超越常人，就不能算是多才多艺。一个女人必须精通音乐、歌唱、图画、舞蹈以及现代语文，那才当得起这个称号；除此以外，她的仪表和步态，她的声调，她的谈吐和表情，都得有相当风趣，否则她就不够资格。”','达西接着说：“她除了具备这些条件以外，还应该多读书，长见识，有点真才实学。”','“怪不得你只认识六个才女啦。我现在简直疑心你连一个也不认识呢。”','“你怎么对你们女人这般苛求，竟以为她们不可能具备这些条件？”','“我从来没见过这样的女人。我从来没见过哪一个人象你所说的这样有才干，有情趣，又那么好学，那么仪态优雅。”','赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐都叫起来了，说她不应该表示怀疑，因为这种怀疑是不公平的，而且她们还一致提出反证，说她们自己就知道有很多女人都够得上这些条件。一直等到赫斯脱先生叫她们好好打牌，怪她们不该对牌场上的事那么漫不经心，她们才住嘴，一场争论就这样结束了，伊丽莎白没有多久也走开了。','门关上之后，彬格莱小姐说，“有些女人们为了自抬身价，往往在男人们面前编派女人，伊丽莎白·班纳特就是这样一个女人，这种手段在某些男人身上也许会发生效果，但是我认为这是一种下贱的诡计，一种卑鄙的手腕。”','达西听出她这几句话是有意说给他自己听的，便连忙答道：“毫无疑问，姑娘们为了勾引男子，有时竟不择手段，使用巧计，这真是卑鄙。只要你的做法带有几分狡诈，都应该受到鄙弃。”','彬格莱小姐不太满意他这个回答，因此也就没有再谈下去。','伊丽莎白又到他们这儿来了一次，只是为了告诉他们一声，她姐姐的病更加严重了，她不能离开。彬格醚再三主张立刻请钟斯大夫来，他的姐妹们却都以为乡下郎中无济于是，主张赶快到城里去请一位最有名的大夫来，伊丽莎白不赞成，不过她也不便太辜负她们兄弟的一番盛意，于是大家协商出了一个办法；如果班纳特小姐明儿一大早依旧毫无起色，就马上去请钟斯大夫来。彬格莱先生心里非常不安，他的姐姐和妹妹也说是十分担忧。吃过晚饭以后，她们俩总算合奏了几支歌来消除了一些烦闷，而彬格莱先生因为想不出好办法来解除焦虑，便只有关照他那管家婆尽心尽意地照料病人和病人的妹妹。','Chapter 9','ELIZABETH passed the chief of the night in her sisters room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast. Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her, that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. ','”Indeed I have, Sir,” was her answer. ”She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.” ','”Removed!” cried Bingley. ”It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.” ','”You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, ”that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.” ','Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. ','”I am sure,” she added, ”if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world -- which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.” ','”Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; ”and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.” ','”That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth. ','”You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her. ','”Oh! yes -- I understand you perfectly.” ','”I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.” ','”That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.” ','”Lizzy,” cried her mother, ”remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.” ','”I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, ”that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.” ','”Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.” ','”The country,” said Darcy, ”can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.” ','”But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.” ','”Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. ”I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.” ','Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph. ','”I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?” ','”When I am in the country,” he replied, ”I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.” ','”Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, ”seemed to think the country was nothing at all.” ','”Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. ”You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.” ','”Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.” ','Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away. ','”Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley -- is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! -- He has always something to say to every body. -- That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.” ','”Did Charlotte dine with you?” ','”No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain -- but then she is our particular friend.” ','”She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley. ','”Oh! dear, yes; -- but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Janes beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane -- one does not often see any body better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiners in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.” ','”And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. ”There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” ','”I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said Darcy. ','”Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.” ','Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. ','Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear. ','”I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement, and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.” ','Lydia declared herself satisfied. ”Oh! yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,” she added, ”I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.” ','Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingleys witticisms on fine eyes. ','伊丽莎白那一晚上的大部分时间都是在她姐姐房间里度过的，第二天一大早，彬格莱先生就派了个女佣人来问候她们。过了一会儿，彬格莱的姐姐妹妹也打发了两个文雅的侍女来探病，伊丽莎白总算可以聊以自慰地告诉她们说，病人已略见好转。不过，她虽然宽了一下心，却还是要求他们府上替她差人送封信到浪博恩去，要她的妈妈来看看吉英，来亲自判断她的病情如何。信立刻就送去了，信上所说的事也很快就照办了。班纳特太太带着两个最小的女儿来到尼日斐花园的时候，他们家里刚刚吃过早饭。 ','倘使班纳特太太发觉吉英有什么危险，那她真要伤心死了；但是一看到吉英的病并不怎么严重，她就满意了；她也并不希望吉英马上复元，因为，要是一复元，她就得离开尼日斐花园回家去。所以她的女儿一提起要她带她回家去，她听也不要听，况且那位差不多跟她同时来到的医生，也认为搬回去不是个好办法。母亲陪着吉英坐了一会儿工夫，彬格莱小姐便来请她吃早饭，于是她就带着三个女儿一块儿上饭厅去。彬格莱先生前来迎接她们，说是希望班纳特太太看到了小姐的病一定会觉得并不是想象中那般严重。','班纳特太太回答道：“我却没有想象到会这般严重呢，先生，她病得太厉害了，根本不能搬动。钟斯大夫也说，千万不可以叫她搬动。我们只得叨光你们多照顾几天啦。”','“搬动！”彬格莱叫道：“绝对不可以。我相信我的妹妹也决计不肯让她搬走的。”彬格莱小姐冷淡而有礼貌地说：“你放心好啦，老太太，班纳特小姐待在我们这儿，我们一定尽心尽意地照顾她。”','班纳特太太连声道谢。','接着她又说道：“要不是靠好朋友们照顾，我相信她真不知道变成什么样儿了；因为她实在病得很重，痛苦得很厉害，不过好在她有极大的耐性──她一贯都是那样的，我生平简直没见过第二个人有她这般温柔到极点的性格。我常常跟别的几个女儿们说，她们比起她来简直太差了。彬格莱先生，你这所房子很可爱呢，从那条鹅卵石铺道上望出去，景致也很美丽。在这个村庄里，我从来没见过一个地方比得上尼日斐花园。虽然你的租期很短，我劝你千万别急着搬走。”','彬格莱先生说：“我随便干什么事，都是说干就干，要是打定主意要离开尼日斐花园，我可能在五分钟之内就搬走。不过目前我算在这儿住定了。”','“我猜想得一点儿不错，”伊丽莎白说。','彬格莱马上转过身去对她大声说道：“你开始了解我啦，是吗？”','“噢，是呀──我完全了解你。”','“但愿你这句话是恭维我，不过，这么容易被人看透，那恐怕也是件可怜的事吧。”','“那得看情况说话。一个深沉复杂的人，未必比你这样的人更难叫人捉摸。”','她有母亲连忙嚷道：“丽萃，别忘了你在作客，家里让你撒野惯了，你可不能到人家这里来胡闹。”','“我以前倒不知道你是个研究人的性格的专家。”彬格莱马上接下去说，“那一定是一门很有趣的学问吧。”','“不错；可是最有趣味的还是研究复杂的性格。至少这样的性格有研究的价值。”','达西说：“一般说来，乡下人可以作为这种研究对象的就很少。因为在乡下，你四周围的人都是非常不开通、非常单调。‘','“可是人们本身的变动很多，他们身上永远有新的东西值得你去注意。”','班纳特太太听到刚刚达西以那样一种口气提到乡下，不禁颇为生气，便连忙嚷道：“这才说得对呀，告诉你吧，乡下可供研究的对象并不比城里少。”','大家都吃了一惊。达西朝她望了一会儿便静悄悄地走开了。班纳特太太自以为完全占了他的上风，便趁着一股兴头说下去：“我觉得伦敦除了店铺和公共场所以外，比起乡下并没有什么大不了的好处。乡下可舒服得多了──不是吗，彬格莱先生？”','“我到了乡下就不想走，”他回答道；“我住到城里也就不想走。乡下和城里各有各的好处，我随便住在哪儿都一样快乐。”','“啊，那是因为你的性格好。可是那位先生，”她说到这里，便朝达西望了一眼，“就会觉得乡下一文不值。”','“妈妈，你根本弄错了，”伊丽莎白这话一出口，她母亲就红了脸。“你完全弄错了达西先生的意思。他只不过说，乡下碰不到象城里那么些各色名样的人，这你可得承认是事实呀。”','“当然罗，宝贝──谁也没那么说过。要是说这个村子里还碰不到多少人，我相信比这大的村庄也就没有几个了。就我所知，平常跟我们来往吃饭的可也有二十四家呀。”','要不是顾全伊丽莎白的面子，彬格莱先生简直忍不住要笑出来了。他的妹妹可没有他那么用心周到，便不由得带着富有表情的笑容望着达西先生。伊丽莎为了找个借口转移一下她母亲的心思，便问她母亲说，自从她离家以后，夏绿蒂·卢卡斯有没有到浪博恩来过。','“来过；她是昨儿跟他父亲一块儿来的。威廉爵士是个多么和蔼的人呀，彬格莱先生──他可不是吗？那么时髦的一个人！那么温雅，又那么随便！他见到什么人总要谈上儿句。这就是我所谓的有良好教养；那些自以为了不起、金口难开的人，他们的想法真是大错而特错。”','“夏绿蒂在我们家里吃饭的吗？”','“没有，她硬要回去。据我猜想，大概是她家里街头等着她回去做肉饼。彬格莱先生，我雇起佣人来，总得要她们能够料理份内的事，我的女儿就不是人家那样教养大的。可是一切要看各人自己，告诉你，卢卡斯家里的几个姑娘全是些很好的女孩子。只可惜长得不漂亮！当然并不是我个人以为夏绿蒂长得难看，她究竟是我们要好的朋友。”','“她看来是位很可爱的姑娘，”彬格莱说。','“是呀，可是你得承认，她的确长得很难看。卢卡斯太太本人也那么说，她还羡慕我的吉英长得漂亮呢。我并不喜欢夸张自己的孩子，可是说老实话。这并不是我说话有信心。还在她十五岁的那一年，在我城里那位兄弟嘉丁纳家里，有位先生就爱上了她，我的弟妇看准了那位先生一定会在临走以前向她求婚。不过后来他却没有提。也许是他以为她年纪太小了吧。不过他却为吉英写了好些诗，而且写得很好。”','“那位先生的一场恋爱就这么结束了，”伊丽莎白不耐烦地说。“我想，多少有情人都是这样把自己克服过来的。诗居然有这种功能──能够赶走爱情，这倒不知道是谁第一个发现的！”','“我却一贯认为，诗是爱情的食粮，”达西说。','“那必须是一种优美、坚贞、健康的爱情才行。本身健强了，吃什么东西都可以获得滋补。要是只不过有一点儿蛛丝马迹，那么我相信，一首十四行诗准会把它断送掉。”','达西只笑了一下，接着大伙儿都沉默了一阵子，这时候伊丽莎白很是着急，怕她母亲又要出丑。她想说点儿什么，可是又想不出什么可说的。沉默了一下以后，班纳特太太又重新向彬格莱先生道谢，说是多亏他对吉英照顾周到，同时又向他道歉说，丽萃也来打扰了他。彬格莱先生回答得极其恳切而有礼貌，弄得他的妹妹也不得不讲礼貌，说了些很得体的话。她说话的态度并不十分自然，可是班纳特太太已经够满意的了。一会儿工夫，班纳特太太就叫预备马车。这个号令一发，她那位顶小的女儿立刻走上前来。原来自从她们母女来到此地，两个女儿就一直在交头接耳地商量，最后说定了由顶小的女儿来要求彬格莱先生兑现他刚以乡下时的诺言，在尼日斐花园开一次跳舞会。','丽迪雅是个胖胖的、发育得很好的姑娘，今年才十五岁，细皮白肉，笑颜常开，她是母亲的掌上明珠，由于娇纵过度，她很小就进入了社交界。她生性好动，天生有些不知分寸，加上她的姨爹一次次以美酒嘉肴宴请那些军官们，军官们又见她颇有几分浪荡的风情，便对她发生了相当好感，于是她更加肆无忌惮了。所以她就有资格向彬格莱先生提出开舞会的事，而且冒冒失失地提醒他先前的诺言，而且还说，要是他不实践诺言，那就是天下最丢人的事。彬格莱先生对她这一番突如其来的挑衅回答得叫她母亲很是高兴。','“我可以向你保证，我非常愿意实践我的诺言；只要等你姐姐复了元，由你随便订个日期就行。你总不愿意在姐姐生病的时候跳舞吧？！”','丽迪雅表示满意。“你这话说得不错。等到吉英复元以后再跳，那真好极了，而且到那时候，卡特尔上尉也许又可能回到麦里屯来。等你开过舞会以后，我一定非要他们也开一次不可。我一定会跟弗斯脱上校说，要是他不开，可真丢人哪。”','于是班纳特太太带着她的两个女儿走了。伊丽莎白立刻回到吉英身边去，也不去管彬格莱府上的两位小姐怎样在背后议论她跟她家里人有失体统。不过，尽管彬格莱小姐怎么样说俏皮话，怎么样拿她的“美丽的眼睛”开玩笑，达西却始终不肯受她们的怂恿，夹在她们一起来编派她的不是。','Chapter 10','THE day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game. Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. ','”How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!” ','He made no answer. ','”You write uncommonly fast.” ','”You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.” ','”How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!” ','”It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.” ','”Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.” ','”I have already told her so once, by your desire.” ','”I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.” ','”Thank you -- but I always mend my own.” ','”How can you contrive to write so even?” ','He was silent. ','”Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantleys.” ','”Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? -- At present I have not room to do them justice.” ','”Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?” ','”They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.” ','”It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.” ','”That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her brother -- ”because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. -- Do not you, Darcy?” ','”My stile of writing is very different from yours.” ','”Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, ”Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.” ','”My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.” ','”Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, ”must disarm reproof.” ','”Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, ”than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.” ','”And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?” ','”The indirect boast; -- for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?” ','”Nay,” cried Bingley, ”this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.” ','”I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ”Bingley, you had better stay till next week,” you would probably do it, you would probably not go -- and, at another word, might stay a month.” ','”You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, ”that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself.” ','”I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, ”by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.” ','”Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?” ','”Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.” ','”You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.” ','”To yield readily -- easily -- to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.” ','”To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.” ','”You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?” ','”Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?” ','”By all means,” cried Bingley; ”Let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do.” ','Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. ','”I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. -- ”You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.” ','”Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.” ','”What you ask,” said Elizabeth, ”is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter,” ','Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. ','When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. ','Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcys eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation. ','After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her -- ','”Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?” ','She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence. ','”Oh!” said she, ”I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ”Yes,” that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare.” ','”Indeed I do not dare.” ','Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger. ','Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth. ','She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance. ','”I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, ”you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. -- And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.” ','”Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?” ','”Oh! yes. -- Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle, the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for your Elizabeths picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?” ','”It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.” ','At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself. ','”I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard. ','”You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, ”in running away without telling us that you were coming out.” Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. ','Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said, -- ','”This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.” ','But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, ','”No, no; stay where you are. -- You are charmingly groupd, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye.” ','She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. ','这一天过得和前一天没有多大的不同。赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐上午陪了病人几个钟头，病人尽管好转得很慢，却在不断地好转。晚上，伊丽莎白跟她们一块儿待在客厅里。不过这一回却没有看见有人打“禄牌”。达西先生在写信，彬格莱小姐坐在他身旁看他写，一再纠缠不清地要他代她附笔问候他的妹妹。赫斯脱先生和彬格莱先生在打“皮克牌”，赫斯脱太太在一旁看他们打。 ','伊丽莎白在做针线，一面留神地听着达西跟彬格莱小姐谈话。只听得彬格莱小姐恭维话说个不停，不是说他的字写得好，就是说他的字迹一行行很齐整，要不就是赞美他的信写得仔细，可是对方却完全是冷冰冰爱理不理。这两个人你问我答，形成了一段奇妙的对白。照这样看来，伊丽莎白的确没有把他们俩看错。','“达西小姐收到了这样的一封信，将会怎样高兴啊！”','他没有回答。','“你写信写得这样快，真是少见。”','“你这话可说得不对。我写得相当慢。”','“你一年里头得写多少封信啊。还得写事务上的信，我看这是够厌烦的吧！”','“这么说，这些信总算幸亏碰到了我，没有碰到你。”','“请你告诉令妹，我很想和她见见面。”','“我已经遵命告诉过她了。”','“我怕你那支笔不大管用了吧。让我来代你修理修理。修笔真是我的拿手好戏。”','“谢谢你的好意，我一向都是自己修理。”','“你怎么写得那么整齐来着？”','他没有作声。','“请告诉令妹，就说我听到她的竖琴弹得进步了。真觉得高兴，还请你告诉她说，她寄来给我装饰桌子的那张美丽的小图案，我真喜欢极了，我觉得比起格兰特小姐的那张真好得太多了。”','“可否请你通融一下，让我把你的喜欢，延迟到下一次写信时再告诉她？这一次我可写不下这么多啦。”','“噢，不要紧。正月里我就可以跟她见面。不过，你老是写那么动人的长信给她吗，达西先生？”','“我的信一般都写得很长；不过是否每封信都写得动人，那可不能由我自己来说了。”','“不过我总觉得，凡是写起长信来一挥而就的人，无论如何也不会写得不好。”','她的哥哥嚷道：“这种恭维话可不能用在达西身上，珈罗琳，因为他并不能够大笔一挥而就，他还得在四个音节的字上面多多推敲。──达西，你可不是这样吗？”','“我写信的风格和你很不同。”','“噢，”彬格莱小姐叫起来了，“查尔斯写起信来，那种潦草随便的态度，简直不可想象。他要漏掉一半字，涂掉一半字。”','“我念头转得太快，简直来有及写，因此有时候收信人读到我的信，反而觉得言之无物。”','“彬格莱先生，”伊丽莎白说，“你这样谦虚，真叫人家本来要责备你也不好意思责备了。”','达西说：“假装谦虚偏偏往往就是信口开河，有时候简直是转弯抹角的自夸？”','“那么，我刚刚那几句谦虚的话，究竟是信口开河呢，还是转弯抹角的自夸？”','“要算是转弯抹角的自夸，因为你对于你自己写信方面的缺点觉得很得意，你认为你思想敏捷，懒得去注意书法，而且你认为你这些方面即使没有什么了不起，完全不考虑到做出来的成绩是不是完美。你今天早上跟班纳特太太说，如果你决定要从尼日斐花园搬走，你五分钟之内就可以搬走，这种话无非是夸耀自己，恭维自己。再说，急躁的结果只会使得应该要做好的事情没有做好，无论对人对已，都没有真正的好处，这有什么值得赞美的呢？”','“得了吧，”彬格莱先生嚷道，“晚上还记起早上的事，真是太不值得。而且老实说，我相信我对于自己的看法并没有错，我到现在还相信没有错。因此，我至少不是故意要显得那么神速，想要在小姐们面前炫耀自己。”','“也许你真的相信你自己的话；可是我怎么也不相信你做事情会那么当机立断。我知道你也跟一般人一样，都是见机行事。譬如你正跨上马要走了，忽然有朋友跟你说：‘彬格莱，你最好还是待到下个星期再走吧。’那你可能就会听他的话，可能就不走了，要是他再跟你说句什么的，你也许就会再待上一个月。”','伊丽莎白叫道：“你这一番话只不过说明了彬格莱先生并没有任着他自己的性子说做就做。你这样一说，比他自己说更来得光彩啦。”','彬格莱说：“我真太高兴了，我的朋友所说的话，经你这么一圆转，反面变成恭维我的话了。不过，我只怕你这种圆转并不投合那位先生的本意，因为：我如果真遇到这种事，我会爽爽快快地谢绝那位朋友，骑上马就走，那他一定更看得起我。”','“那么，难道达西先生认为，不管你本来的打算是多么轻率卤莽，只要你一打定主意就坚持到底，也就情有可原了吗？”','“老实说，我也解释不清楚；那得由达西自己来说明。”','“你想要把这些意见说成我的意见，我可从来没承认过。不过，班纳特小姐，即使把你所说的这种种情形假定为真有其事，你可别忘了这一点：那个朋友固然叫他回到屋子里去叫他不要那么说做就做，可是那也不过是那位朋友有那么一种希望，对他提出那么一个要求，可并没有坚持要他非那样做不可。”','“说到随随便便地轻易听从一个朋友的劝告，在你身上可还找不出这个优点。”','“如果不问是非，随随便便就听从，恐怕对于两个人全不能算是一种恭维吧。”','“达西先生，我觉得你未免否定了友谊和感情对于一个人的影响。要知道，一个人如果尊重别人提出的要求，通常都是用不着说服就会心甘情愿地听从的。我并不是因为你说到彬格莱先生而就借题发挥。也许我们可以等到真有这种事情发生的时候，再来讨论他处理得是不适当。不过一般说来，朋友与朋友相处，遇到一件无关紧要的事情的时候，一个已经打定主意，另一个要他改变一下主意，如果被要求的人不等到到对方加以说服，就听众了对方的意见，你能说他有什么不是吗？”','“我们且慢讨论这个问题，不妨先仔仔细细研究一下，那个朋友提出的要求究竟重要到什么程度，他们两个人的交情又深到什么程度，这样好不好？”','彬格莱大声说道：“好极了，请你仔仔细细讲吧，连到他们的身材的高矮和大小也别忘了讲，因为，班纳特小姐，你一定想象不到讨论起问题来的时候这一点是多么重要。老实对你说，要是达西先生不比我高那么多，大那么多，你才休想叫我那么尊敬他。在某些时候，某些场合，达西是个再讨厌不过的家伙──特别是礼拜天晚上在他家里，当他没有事情做的时候。”','达西微笑了一下，伊丽莎白本来要笑，可是觉得他好象有些生气了，便忍住了没有笑。彬格莱小姐看见人家拿他开玩笑，很是生气，便怪她的哥哥干吗要谈这样没意思的话。','达西说：“我明白你的用意，彬格莱，你不喜欢辩论，要把这场辩论压下去。”','“我也许真是这样。辩论往往很象争论，假若你和班纳特小姐能够稍缓一下等我走出房间以后再，辩论那我是非常感激的。我走出去以后，你们便可以爱怎么说我就怎么说我了。”','伊丽莎白说：“你要这样做，对我并没有什么损失；达西先生还是去把信写好吧。”','达西先生听从了她的意见，去把那封信写好。','这件事过去以后，达西要求彬格莱小姐和伊丽莎白小姐赏赐他一点音乐听听，彬格莱小姐便敏捷地走钢琴跟前，先客气了一番，请伊丽莎白带头，伊丽莎白却更加客气、更加诚恳地推辞了，然后彬格莱小姐才在琴旁坐下来。','赫斯脱太太替她妹妹伴唱。当她们姐妹俩演奏的时候，伊丽莎白翻阅着钢琴上的几本琴谱，只见达西先生的眼睛总是望着她。如果说，这位了不起的人这样看着她是出于爱慕之意，她可不大敢存这种奢望，不过，要是说达西是因为讨厌她所以才望着她，那就更说不通了。最后，她只得这样想；她所以引起了达西的注意，大概是因为达西认为她比起在座的任何人来，都叫人看不顺眼。她作出了这个假想之后，并没有感到痛苦，因为她根本不喜欢他，因此不稀罕他的垂青。','彬格莱小姐弹了几支意大利歌曲以后，便改弹了一些活泼的苏格兰曲子来变换变换情调。不大一会儿工夫，达西先生走到伊丽莎白跟前来，跟她说：','“班纳特小姐，你是不是很想趁这个机会来跳一次苏格兰舞？”','伊丽莎白没有回答他，只是笑了笑。他见她闷声不响，觉得有点儿奇怪，便又问了她一次。','“噢，”她说，“我早就听见了；可是我一下子拿不准应该怎样回答你。当然，我知道你希望我回答一声‘是的’那你就会蔑视我的低级趣味，好让你自己得意一番，只可惜我一向喜欢戳穿人家的诡计，作弄一下那些存心想要蔑视人的人。因此，我决定跟你说，我根本不爱跳苏格兰舞；这一下你可不敢蔑视我了吧。”','“果真不敢。”','伊丽莎白本来打算使他难堪一下，这会儿见他那么体贴，倒楞住了。不过，伊丽莎白的为人一贯温柔乖巧，不轻易得罪任何人，而达西又对她非常着迷，以前任何女人也不曾使他这样着迷过。他不由得一本正经地想道，要不是她的亲戚出身微贱，那我难免危险了。','彬格莱小姐见到这般光景，很是嫉妒，或者也可以说是她疑心病重，因此由疑而妒。于是她愈想把伊丽莎白撵走，就愈巴不得她的好朋友吉英病体赶快复元。','为了挑拨达西厌恶这位客人，她常常闲言闲语，说他跟伊丽莎白终将结成美满良缘，而且估料着这一门良缘会给达西带来多大幸福。','第二天彬格莱小姐跟达西两人在矮树林里散步，彬格莱小姐说：“我希望将来有一天好事如愿的时候，你得委婉地奉劝你那位岳母出言吐语要谨慎些，还有你那几位小姨子，要是你能力办得到，最好也得把她们那种醉心追求军官的毛病医治好。还有一件事，我真不好意思说出口；尊夫人有一点儿小脾气，好象是自高自大，又好象是不懂礼貌，你也得尽力帮助她克制一下。”','“关于促进我的家庭幸福方面，你还有什么别的意见吗？”','“噢，有的是。千万把你姨丈人姨丈母的像挂到彭伯里画廊里面去，就挂在你那位当法官的伯祖父大人遗象旁边。你知道他们都是同行，只不过部门不同而已。至于尊夫人伊丽莎白，可千万别让别人替她画像，天下哪一个画家能够把她那一双美丽的眼睛画得维妙维肖？”','“那双眼睛的神气确不容易描画；可是眼睛的形状和颜色，以及她的睫毛，都非常美妙，也许描画得出来。”','他们正谈得起劲和时候，忽然看见赫斯脱太太和伊丽莎白从另外一条路走过来。','彬格莱小姐连忙招呼她们说：“我不知道你们也想出来散散步，”她说这话的时候，心里很有些惴惴不安，因为她恐怕刚才的话让她们听见了。','“你们也太对不起我们了，”赫斯脱太太回答道，“只顾自己出来，也不告诉我们一声。”','接着她就挽住达西空着的那条臂膀，丢下伊丽莎白，让她独个儿去走。这条路恰巧只容得下三个人并排走。达西先生觉得她们太冒味了，便说道：','“这条路太窄，不能让我们大家一块儿并排走，我们不是走到大道上去吧。”','伊丽莎白本不想跟他们待在一起，一听这话，便笑嘻嘻地说：','“不用啦，不用啦；你们就在这儿走走吧。你们三个人在一起走非常好看，而且很出色。加上第四个人，画面就给弄毁了。再见。”','于是她就得意洋洋地跑开了。她一面跪溜达，一面想到一两天内就可以回家，觉得很高兴。吉英的病已经大为好转，当天晚上就想走出房间去玩它两个钟头。','Chapter 11','WHEN the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and, seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object. Miss Bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was ”very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingleys salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. ','When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss Bennet. ','Miss Bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcys progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, ”How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” ','No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, ','”By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? -- I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.” ','”If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, ”he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins -- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.” ','”I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, ”if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.” ','”Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.” ','Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; -- but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and turning to Elizabeth, said, ','”Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. -- I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.” ','Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. ”What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning” -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? ','”Not at all,” was her answer; ”but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.” ','Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. ','”I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. ”You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; -- if the first, I should be completely in your way; -- and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.” ','”Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. ”I never heard any thing so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?” ','”Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. ”We can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him -- laugh at him. -- Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.” ','”But upon my honour I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no -- I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.” ','”Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. ”That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh.” ','”Miss Bingley,” said he, ”has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.” ','”Certainly,” replied Elizabeth -- ”there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. -- But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.” ','”Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.” ','”Such as vanity and pride.” ','”Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.” ','Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. ','”Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley; -- ”and pray what is the result?” ','”I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.” ','”No” -- said Darcy, ”I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. -- It is I believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. -- My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.” ','”That is a failing indeed!” -- cried Elizabeth. ”Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. -- I really cannot laugh at it; you are safe from me.” ','”There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.” ','”And your defect is a propensity to hate every body.” ','”And yours,” he replied with a smile, ”is wilfully to misunderstand them.” ','”Do let us have a little music,” -- cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. -- ”Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst.” ','Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention. ','娘儿们吃过晚饭以后，伊丽莎白就上楼到她姐姐那儿去，看她穿戴得妥妥贴贴，不会着凉，便陪着她上客厅去。她的女朋友们见到她，都表示欢迎，一个个都说非常高兴。在男客们没有来的那一个钟头里，她们是那么和蔼可亲，伊丽莎白从来不曾看到过。她们的健谈本领真是吓人，描述起宴会来纤毫入微，说起故事来风趣横溢，讥笑起一个朋友来也是有声有色。 ','可是男客们一走进来，吉英就不怎么引人注目了。达西一进门，彬格莱小姐的眼睛就立刻转到他身上去，要跟他说话。达西首先向班纳特小姐问好，客客气气地祝贺她病休复元；赫斯脱先生也对她微微一鞠躬，说是见到她“非常高兴”；但是说到词气周到，情意恳切，可就比不上彬格莱先生那几声问候。彬格莱先生才算得上情深意切，满怀欢欣。开头半小时完全消磨在添煤上面，生怕屋子里冷起来会叫病人受不了。吉英依照彬格莱的话，移坐到火炉的另一边去，那样她就离开门口远一些，免得受凉。接着他自己在她身旁坐下，一心跟她说话，简直不理睬别人。伊丽莎白正在对面角落里做活计，把这全部情景都看在眼里，感到无限高兴。','喝过茶以后，赫斯脱先生提醒她的小姨子把牌桌摆好，可是没有用。她早就看出达西先生不想打牌，因此赫斯脱先生后来公开提出要打牌也被她拒绝了。她跟他说，谁也不想玩牌，只见全场对这件事都不作声，看来她的确没有说错。因此，赫斯脱先生无事可做，只得躺在沙发上打瞌睡。达西拿起一本书来。彬格莱小姐也拿起一本书来。赫斯脱太太聚精会神地在玩弄自己的手镯和指环，偶而也在她弟弟跟班纳特小姐的对话中插几句嘴。','彬格莱小姐一面看达西读书，一面自己读书，两件事同时并做，都是半心半意。她老是向他问句什么的，或者是看他读到哪一页。不过，她总是没有办法逗她说话；她问一句他就答一句，答过以后便继续读他的书。彬格莱小姐所以要挑选那一本书读，只不过因为那是达西所读的第二卷，她满想读个津津有味，不料这会儿倒读得精疲力尽了。她打了个呵欠，说道：“这样度过一个晚上，真是多么愉快啊！我说呀，什么娱乐也抵不上读书的乐趣。无论干什么事，都是一上手就要厌倦，读书却不会这样！将来有一天我自己有了家，要是没有个很好的书房，那会多遗憾哟。”','谁也没有理睬她。于是她又打了个呵欠，抛开书本，把整个房间里望了一转，要想找点儿什么东西消遗消遗，这时忽听得她哥哥跟班纳特小姐说要开一次跳舞会，她就猛可地掉过头来对他说：','“这样说，查尔斯，你真打算在尼日斐花园开一次跳舞会吗？我劝你最好还是先征求一下在场朋友们的意见再作决定吧。这里面就会有人觉得跳舞是受罪，而不是娱乐，要是没有这种人，你怪我好了。”','“如果你指的是达西，”她的哥哥大声说，“那么，他可以在跳舞开始以前就上床去睡觉，随他的便好啦。舞会已经决定了非开不可，只等尼可尔斯把一切都准备好了，我就下请贴。”','彬格莱小姐说：“要是开舞会能换些花样，那我就更高兴了，通常舞会上的那老一套，实在讨厌透顶。你如果能把那一天的日程改一改，用谈话来代替跳舞，那一定有意思得多。”','“也许有意思得多，珈罗琳，可是那还象什么舞会呢。”','彬格莱小姐没有回答。不大一会儿工夫，她就站起身来，在房间里踱来踱去，故意在达西面前卖弄她优美的体态和矫健的步伐，只可惜达西只顾在那里一心一意地看书，因此她只落得枉费心机。她绝望之余，决定再作一次努力，于是转过身来对伊丽莎白说：','“伊丽莎·班纳特小姐，我劝你还是学学我的样子，在房间里瞎走动走动吧。告诉你，坐了那么久，走动一下可以提提精神。”','伊丽莎白觉得很诧异，可是立刻依了她的意思。于是彬格莱小姐献殷勤的真正目的达到了──达西先生果然抬起头来，原来达西也和伊丽莎白一样，看出了她在耍花招引人注目，便不知不觉地放下了书本。两位小姐立刻请他来一块儿踱步，可是他谢绝了，说是她们俩所以要在屋子里踱来踱去，据他的想象，无非有两个动机，如果他参加她们一起散步，对于她们的任何一个动机都会有妨碍。他这话是什么意思？彬格莱小姐极想知道他讲这话用意何在，便问伊丽莎白懂不懂。','伊丽莎白回答道：“根本不懂，他一定是存心刁难我们，不过你最好不要理睬他，让他失望一下。”','可惜彬格莱小姐遇到任何事情都不忍心叫达西先生失望，于是再三要求他非把他的所谓两个动机解释一下不可。','达西等她一住口，便马上说：“我非常愿意解释一下，事情不外乎是这样的，你们是心腹之交，所以选择了这个办法来消磨黄昏，还要谈谈私事，否则就是你们自以为散起步来体态显得特别好看，所以要散散步。倘若是出于第一个动机，我夹在你们一起就会妨碍你们；假若是出于第二个动机，那么我坐在火炉旁边可以更好地欣赏你们。”','“噢，吓坏人！”彬格莱小姐叫起来了。“我从来没听到过这么毒辣的话。──亏他说得出，该怎么罚他呀？”','“要是你存心罚他，那是再容易不过的事，”伊丽莎白说。“彼此都可以罚来罚去，折磨来折磨去。作弄他一番吧──讥笑他一番吧。你们既然这么相熟，你该懂得怎么对付他呀。”','“天地良心，我不懂得。不瞒你说，我们虽然相熟，可是要懂得怎样来对付他，不差得远呢。想要对付这种性格冷静和头脑机灵的人，可不容易！不行，不行，我想我们是搞不过他的。至于讥笑他，说句你不生气的话，我们可不能凭空笑人家，弄得反而惹人笑话。让达西先生去自鸣得意吧。”','“原来达西先生是不能让人笑话的！”伊丽莎白嚷道。“这种优越的条件倒真少有，我希望一直不要多，这样的朋友多了，我的损失可大啦。我特别喜欢笑话。“','“彬格莱小姐过奖我啦。”他说。“要是一个人把开玩笑当作人生最重要的事，那么，最聪明最优秀的人───不，最聪明最优秀的行为───也就会变得可笑了。”','“那当然罗，”伊丽莎白回答道，“这样的人的确有，可是我希望我自己不在其内。我希望我怎么样也不会讥笑聪明的行为或者是良好的行为。愚蠢和无聊，荒唐和矛盾，这的确叫我觉得好笑，我自己也承认，我只要能够加以讥笑，总是加以讥笑。不过我觉得这些弱点正是你身上所没有的。”','“或许谁都还会有这些弱点，否则可真糟了，绝顶的聪慧也要招人嘲笑了。我一生都在研究该怎么样避免这些弱点。”','“例如虚荣和傲慢就是属于这一类弱点。”','“不错，虚荣的确是个弱点。可是傲慢──只要你果真聪明过人──你就会傲慢得比较有分寸。”','伊丽莎白掉过头去，免得人家看见她发笑。','“你考问达西先生考问好了吧，我想，”彬格莱小姐说。“请问结论如何？”','“我完全承认达西先生没有一些缺点。他自己也承认了这一点，并没有掩饰。”','“不，”达西说，“我并没有说过这种装场面的话。我有够多的毛病，不过这些毛病与头脑并没有关系。至于我的性格，我可不敢自夸。我认为我的性格太不能委曲求全，这当然是说我在处世方面太不能委曲求全地随和别人。别人的愚蠢和过错我本应该赶快忘掉，却偏偏忘不掉；人家得罪了我，我也忘不掉。说到我的一些情绪，也并不是我一打算把它们去除掉，它们就会烟消云散。我的脾气可以说是够叫人厌恶的。我对于某个人一旦没有了好感，就永远没有好感。”','“这倒的的确确是个大缺点！”伊丽莎白大声说道。“跟人家怨恨不解，的确是性格上的一个阴影可是你对于自己的缺点，已经挑剔得很严格。我的确不能再讥笑你了。你放心好啦。”','“我，相信一个人不管是怎样的脾气，都免不了有某种短处，这是一种天生的缺陷，即使受教育受得再好，也还是克服不了。”','“你有一种倾向，──对什么人都感到厌恶，这就是你的缺陷。”','“而你的缺陷呢，”达西笑着回答。“就是故意去误解别人。”','彬格莱小姐眼见这场谈话没有她的份，不禁有些厌倦，便大声说道：“让我们来听听音乐吧，露薏莎，你不怕我吵醒赫斯脱先生吗？”','她的姐姐毫不反对，于是钢琴便打开了。达西想了一下，觉得这样也不错。他开始感觉到对伊丽莎白似乎已经过分亲近了一些。','Chapter 12','IN consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Janes week, could not bring herself to receive hem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeths wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added that, if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. -- Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingleys carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. ','The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day, to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. ','The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. ','To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence -- Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked -- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her. ','On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingleys civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. -- Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits. ','They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. -- But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth. ','They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married. ','班纳特姐妹俩商量妥当了以后，伊丽莎白第二天早上就写信给她母亲，请她当天就派车子来接她们。可是，班纳特太太早就打算让她两个女儿在尼日斐花园待到下星期二，以便让吉英正好住满一个星期，因此不大乐意提前接她们回家，回信也写得使她们不太满意，──至少使伊丽莎白不十分满意，因为她急于要回家。班纳特太太信上说，非到星期二，家里弄不出马车来。她写完信之后，又补写了几句，说是倘若彬格莱先生兄妹挽留她们多待几天，她非常愿意让她们待下去。怎奈伊丽莎白就是不肯待下去，她打定主意非回家不可──也不怎么指望主人家挽留她们，她反而怕人家以为她们赖在那儿不肯走。于是她催促吉英马上去向彬格莱借马车。她们最后决定向主人家说明，她们当天上午就要离开尼日斐花园，而且把借马车的事也提出来。 ','主人家听到这话，表示百般关切，便再三挽留她们，希望她们至少待到下一天再走，吉英让她们说服了，于是姐妹俩只得再耽搁一天。这一下可叫彬格莱小姐后悔挽留她们，她对伊丽莎白又嫉妒又讨厌，因此也就顾不得对吉英的感情了。彬格莱听到她们马上要走非常发愁，便一遍又一遍劝导吉英，说她还没有完全复元，马上就走不大妥当，可是吉英既然觉得自己的主张是对的便再三坚持。','不过达西却觉得这是个好消息，他认为伊丽莎白在尼日斐花园待得够久了。他没想到这次会给她弄得这般地心醉，加上彬格莱小姐一方面对她没礼貌，另方面又越发拿他自己开玩笑。他灵机一动，决定叫自己特别当心些，目前决不要流露出对她有什么爱慕的意思───一点儿形迹也不要流露出来，免得她存非份之想，就此要操纵我达西的终身幸福。他感觉到，假如她存了那种心，那么一定是他昨天对待她的态度起了举足轻重的作用──叫她不是对他更有好感，便是把他完全厌弃。他这样拿定了主意，于是星期六一整天简直没有跟她说上十句话。虽然他那天曾经有一次跟她单独在一起待了半小时之久，他却正大光明地用心看书，看也没看她一眼。','星期日做过晨祷以后，班家两姐妹立即告辞，主人家几乎人人乐意。彬格莱小姐对伊丽莎白一下子变得有礼貌起来了，对吉英也一下子变得亲热了。分手的时候，她先跟吉英说，非常盼望以后有机会在浪博恩或者在尼日斐花园跟她重逢，接着又十分亲切地拥抱了她一番，甚至还跟伊丽莎白握了握手。伊丽莎白高高兴兴地告别了大家。','到家以后，母亲并不怎么热诚地欢迎她们。班纳特太太奇怪她们俩怎么竟会提前回来，非常埋怨她们给家里招来那么多麻烦，说是吉英十拿九稳地又要伤风了。倒是她们的父亲，看到两个女儿回家来了，嘴上虽然没有说什么欢天喜地的话，心里确实非常高兴。他早就体会到，这两个女儿在家里的地位多么重要。晚上一家人聚在一起聊天的时候，要是吉英和伊丽莎白不在场，就没有劲，甚至毫无意义。','她们发觉曼丽还象以往一样，在埋头研究和声学以及人性的问题，她拿出了一些新的札记给她们欣赏，又发表一些对旧道德的新见解给她们听。咖苔琳和丽迪雅也告诉了她们一些新闻，可是性质完全不同。据她们说，民兵团自从上星期三以来又出了好多事，添了好多传说；有几个军官新近跟她们的姨爹吃过饭；一个士兵挨了鞭打，又听说弗斯脱上校的确快结婚了。'
